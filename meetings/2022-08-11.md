## **Notes**

**GenevaERS Annual Review-** Ms. Orth provided the annual review for GenevaERS. She noted creating a docker container, completing Phase One of their training documentation, hosting Demos, and releasing supplementary videos and a Wiki to explain the Demos. Kip Twitchell was published in a journal, Enterprise Systems journal. They will be working on the Performance Build Process and continuing work on their training documentation. Mr. Santalucia asked if there are plans for other container technologies aside from Docker. Ms. Orth said there have been some high level discussions but nothing has been decided at this time.

A motion to approve the GenevaERS project for another year in the Graduated phase was made by Mr Tully. Mr. Frix seconded the motion and all were in favor.

**Zowe Annual Review-** Mr. Grady presented the review. Zowe continues to grow and when you total the downloads, they amount to nearly one million. They are also growing in publicity and have won some awards. They launched V2 in May. They will be working on a year-long roadmap and include all Zowe projects with deliverables by quarter. Mr. Frix asked if they have any idea of what V3 might look like. Mr. Grady said they do have a roadmap with a cadence. They are allowed to do enhancements within versions without breaking changes. They don’t have a clear picture of V3 yet.

A motion to approve the Zowe project for another year in the Graduated phase was made by Mr. Frix. Mr Tully seconded the motion and all were in favor.

**Reminders on Open Mainframe Summit-** Ms. Kilborn let the TAC know that there were 81 people registered for the Open Mainframe Summit as of August 8. More than half are in-person attendees. She advised of the rate increase after August 19th. She also let everyone know of the opportunity to secure space for project meetings during the summit. A link to reserve space will be sent out soon. 

**Zowe ZVM SSH Server Discussion-** Mr. Tully mentioned this topic was brought up on the slack channel and was hoping to discuss along with Neale Ferguson. Mr. Grady said it was something that had interested them but it hasn’t gone any further. Mr. Grady will connect with Joe Devlin and Neale to discuss this.

**Project Reviews**- COBOL Working group will present on 8/25 and the calendar can be viewed for the other dates online.

**Project Updates-**

**Mentorship-** Ms. Kilborn mentioned all mentees have completed midterms and the program will be wrapping up on 8/31 at which time final evaluations will be due.
