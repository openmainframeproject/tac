**Call for Ambassadors and renewal of existing ambassadors-** 

Mr. Mertic asked the TAC about the current ambassador program and asked for feedback before announcing the 2023 program and puting out a call for applications. Current TAC members who are ambassadors think the progam is going well and can continue as is.

**Mentorship Annual Review-**

Mr. Dahlberg provided a recap of the Mentorship program and the statistics from the past year. The program has seen tremendous growth, and has had the most applicants ever at nearly 600 over the summer. Mr. Dahlberg announced he would be stepping down due to increased responsibilities at VCU. Mr. Mertic mentioned turning the project into a program. The TAC is on-board with this transition due to the amount of manpower that the growth this project has seen now needs.

 
**Linux Distributions WG annual review-** 

Ms. Joseph presented the annual review for the Linux Distributions Working Group. The group has been successful at bringing issues to monthly meetings and collaborating to find solutions. They hope to recruit more distributions and to invite key upstream projects. 


    Resolution: Extend the Linux Distributions Working Group for another year. Mr. Tully motioned for approval, Mr. Grady seconded, and all were in favor.

**TSTerm Annual Review-**

This will be rescheduled to the next meeting 


 
**Discuss Mainframe Project Onboarding Process**- 

There was discussion among the TAC members about the best approach to establish a process. After some back and forth, it was decided that Mr. Santalucia will take this back to some of his colleagues to assess the goals and objectives and present a plan to the TAC.
