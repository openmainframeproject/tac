## Notes

z/VM Cloud Connector

TerseDecompress needs to do one final thing and it will be ready to publically announce.

Internship program selections under way - 104 applications this year. Finalizing selections by March 25th. Some confusion on active projects vs inactive. Looking at Community Bridge for the backend for next year.

Zowe community doing well, discussion now on supporting and maintaining releases through the subprojects. Seeing more applications being built on Zowe.

No updates on the OSMF Workflows proposal yet - plan to have refined proposal for next week.

ICP on Z no updates, Ingo possibily sees a project for the group to work on.

Matt H asked if there was a good way to identify open source projects not working on s390x. Lots of discussion, shared several resources:

Plan to do meeting before next TSC meeting to come up with structure for this effort.
