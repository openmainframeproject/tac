* TOC
{:toc}

{{ site.foundation_name }} aims to foster a collaborative, inclusive, and safe environment for all participants. {{ site.foundation_name }} and each hosted project has established Codes of Conduct to help provide guidelines on appropriate conduct and how to report violations.

For all hosted projects, refer to the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file in each code repository that points to the policy in use.

For all other activities and events that are sanctioned by {{ site.foundation_name }}, refer to the [LF Events Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

## Transparency Report

This report summarizes Code of Conduct incidents reported to or resolved by the TAC. Code of Conduct incidents occurring in the {{ site.foundation_name }} community reported to and resolved by the Linux Foundation Events team (LF Events), or project-level Code of Conduct responders are not addressed in this report. LF Events publishes its own separate transparency report, available [here](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/linux-foundation-events-code-of-conduct-transparency-report-2021-event-summary).

This report aims to provide a balance between transparency and protecting the privacy of victims and reporters to ensure a safe space for reporting. To ensure we are honoring our commitment to protect victims’ and reporters’ privacy, this transparency report does not provide personally identifying information about victims or reporters and provides only summary information rather than details of each incident.

All incidents resolved by the TAC have been handled in accordance with the Open Mainframe Project Code of Conduct policy and guidelines.

### Incidents Reported in 2025
