**Software Discovery Tool annual review-**
 Ms. Joseph provided a review of the Software Discovery Tool Project, they are not yet ready to graduate.  Mr. Twitchell asked where the committer diversity comes from. Ms. Joseph believes it is partly from Whose problem does the tool solve and why should they contribute? What would the tool do for them that helps with “personas.” Mr. Metric asked if they have had interest from outside mainframe communities; Ms. Joseph said no but it may be something to look into.
A motion to approve the Software Discovery Tool project for another year of incubation was made by  Mr. Twitchell and seconded by Mr. Dahlberg, all were in favor.

**TerseDecompress incubation renewal-**
There was discussion about moving this project into an Emeritus status after six months of inactivity. Per the charter, this can be done with two-thirds TAC board vote.

**Reminders on Open Mainframe Summit-** Mr. Mertic let the TAC members know that the board met on 5/11 and they are exploring converting to a hybrid option and adding a virtual option. Mr. Santalucia said he spoke to some people and they were happy to hear this.

**Project Updates-**
Srinivasan said they are trying to get more applicants for mentorship.
GenevaERS- will be transiting the TAC seat. 
Mentorships- meeting soon to discuss the mentees. Mr. Dahlberg will be sending a google form so that the mentors can start choosing their top mentees. We are up to more than 425 mentee applications.

### Notes

-**Open Mainframe Summit update-** The call for papers deadline is 2022-06-10. The event will be hybrid and speakers can apply to speak virtually.


-Mr. Phil Tully has left ADP and there is now a vacant seat for the TAC seat. If someone is interested in filling that role, please let us know.

-Mr. Bruce Hayden **z/VM Community Tools annual review.** There have been some meetings to discuss the direction of the project. Mr. Moling also attended and mentioned some struggles with the project. They are looking to develop a format for information about the tool and where to host the information and list of tools and where to maintain. Github seems to be a good option but would be a learning curve. Mr. Twitchell said they are in the process of developing a tool set that would allow them to interact with Github. Mr. Moling said they would look to do the same.

-Ambitus will present their annual review in July with the hopes of moving out of the sandbox stage. 

-Mr. Metric provided a presentation on **“Scaling up.”** He highlighted Kubernetes as an example project that has been successful at doing this. There are tools available to assist such as LF Insights that can help. He recommended building contributor’s guides for those who may not know how to engage. Some projects have office hours, mentorship programs. It is also important to recognize contributors. Projects should have a “getting started guide” with perhaps videos. Outreach is another tactic. Training is an important part of scaling up. The LF can help partner with projects on training and certification programs. Ms. Joseph mentioned she is currently creating issues to create a contributor guide for her program. Mr. Shah said he’s seen some companies who don’t allow their employees to to contribute code while employed with and Mr. Mertic said he has seen this quite a bit. Case studies and end-user studies are an important part to help other end users in their decision-making.

## 
**Notes**


**Ambitus Annual Review-** Mr. Bostian presented the annual review for the Ambitus project. He noted success in demonstrating how open source software works with IBM z platforms and strengths in open mainframes. There have been some tools created under Ambitus. He mentioned there hasn’t been much development in the public square for downstream OSS development and challenges that have made it more difficult than anticipated, such as vulnerabilities, security, and attacks. He mentioned taking advantage of things like LFX to help with things like this. 

They created a tool that allows for a published Z/OS control box that allows users to go off and write applications that they can easily explore. There's a Python toolkit for going off and doing various kinds of Z/OS type tasks and interfaces to various components of the system through Python interfaces. In the next year he would like to focus on downstream development and secure best practices. 

Mr. Bostian mentioned wanting to get through the open SSL Best Practices badge or certification. Mr. Edelson brought up the Z/OS Open Tools Project. Mr. Bostian thinks Ambitus may be a good fit and would like to set up a meeting with Mike and Mr. Mertic.

Ms. Kilborn will send an email to the voting TAC members for a vote to renew the project at incubator status for another year due.

**Participation in Open Source Summit Europe- Dublin-** Likely skipping this and hoping the Mini Summit will be a Zowe Day but we are awaiting confirmation.

**Reminders on Open Mainframe Summit**- Early bird registration runs through 7/15. There is a mentee registration code for virtual attendance that will be sent out- (OMS22MENTEE). A press release with the schedule went out yesterday and there has been some media requests as a result.  

**Review upcoming annual reviews**-Zowe next is on 7/28 followed by GenevaERS on 8/11. The schedule is posted on: [https://tac.openmainframeproject.org/process/review_cycle.html](https://tac.openmainframeproject.org/process/review_cycle.html)

**Project updates**

**Mentorships**- A reminder to OMP mentors that the midterm meeting for the Summer Cohort is coming up on July 19th at 7 pm EST.  We will want mentee status and will discuss final objectives and OMP conference presentations (in September) by mentees.

Students should prepare a short status report for the midterm meeting.  Nothing elaborate.  They should include: (1) accomplishments so far, (2) what they are currently working on and have left to do.  (3) identify any problems or issues they have encountered, and especially any outstanding issues.

**Zowe-** Mr. Grady had to leave but left the following notes: “Today we are entering RC generation for v2.2 of zowe. This is notable on the server-side in that it adds a new utility, 'configmgr', which reuses our existing codebase in a new and useful way. It can read multiple YAML config files, even YAML config within parmlibs, and can resolve template references within them. it will also cross-reference the values against the config schema, to ensure the user did not make a typo that would affect the zowe run. this utility can be used stand-alone if people wish to script around it, but it is our plan to enhance our existing startup logic to utilize it in existing zowe commands starting in the release after, v2.3

Aside from that, the Program Increment is wrapping up. Squads are considering what they will do in the next PI, and at the beginning of it we want to do a better Innovation Week than ever before. We want anyone interested to present their hackathon-style idea in a public meeting prior to the kickoff event, to get team members that would like to cooperate on doing something zowe-related that's innovative even if it doesn't fit with existing goals.

Also, the TSC has approved 2 new documents: One on rules and messaging the zowe community will follow for what is/isn't a breaking change and how it is communicated in advance. And one on a public document for how zowe community responds to and reports on security vulnerabilities.”

**GenevaERS-** Ms. Orth updated on the project and mentioned moving the GenevaERS mainframe IBM internal GitHub to the public. 
 
**Zorow-** Mr. Shah said it is stable and he’s not seeing any additional workflows coming from his ISV’s so they are still working with that community to publish it.

She noted creating a docker container, completing Phase One of their training documentation, hosting Demos, and releasing supplementary videos and a Wiki to explain the Demos. Kip Twitchell was published in a journal, Enterprise Systems journal. They will be working on the Performance Build Process and continuing work on their training documentation. Mr. Santalucia asked if there are plans for other container technologies aside from Docker. Ms. Orth said there have been some high level discussions but nothing has been decided at this time.

A motion to approve the GenevaERS project for another year in the Graduated phase was made by Mr Tully. Mr. Frix seconded the motion and all were in favor.

**Zowe Annual Review-** Mr. Grady presented the review. Zowe continues to grow and when you total the downloads, they amount to nearly one million. They are also growing in publicity and have won some awards. They launched V2 in May. They will be working on a year-long roadmap and include all Zowe projects with deliverables by quarter. Mr. Frix asked if they have any idea of what V3 might look like. Mr. Grady said they do have a roadmap with a cadence. They are allowed to do enhancements within versions without breaking changes. They don’t have a clear picture of V3 yet.

A motion to approve the Zowe project for another year in the Graduated phase was made by Mr. Frix. Mr Tully seconded the motion and all were in favor.

**Reminders on Open Mainframe Summit-** Ms. Kilborn let the TAC know that there were 81 people registered for the Open Mainframe Summit as of August 8. More than half are in-person attendees.

## **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Notes</span>**


**Call for Ambassadors and renewal of existing ambassadors-** 

Mr. Mertic asked the TAC about the current ambassador program and asked for feedback before announcing the 2023 program and puting out a call for applications. Current TAC members who are ambassadors think the progam is going well and can continue as is. [https://tac.openmainframeproject.org/programs/ambassadors.html](https://tac.openmainframeproject.org/programs/ambassadors.html)

**Mentorship Annual Review-**

Mr. Dahlberg provided a recap of the Mentorship program and the statistics from the past year. The program has seen tremendous growth, and has had the most applicants ever at nearly 600 over the summer. Mr. Dahlberg announced he would be stepping down due to increased responsibilities at VCU. Mr. Mertic mentioned turning the project into a program. The TAC is on-board with this transition due to the amount of manpower that the growth this project has seen now needs.

 
**Linux Distributions WG annual review-** 

Ms. Joseph presented the annual review for the Linux Distributions Working Group. The group has been successful at bringing issues to monthly meetings and collaborating to find solutions. They hope to recruit more distributions and to invite key upstream projects. 


    Resolution: Extend the Linux Distributions Working Group for another year. Mr. Tully motioned for approval, Mr. Grady seconded, and all were in favor.

**TSTerm Annual Review-**

This will be rescheduled to the next meeting 


 
**Discuss Mainframe Project Onboarding Process**- 

There was discussion among the TAC members about the best approach to establish a process. After some back and forth, it was decided that Mr. Santalucia will take this back to some of his colleagues to assess the goals and objectives and present a plan to the TAC.
