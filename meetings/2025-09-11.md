## TAC Strategy Session

## Looking for Open Mainframe Projects for Western Students

Friesnegger reported that Western University is interested in developing mentorship programs for their students with the Open Mainframe Project.  Discussion ensued, and the TAC agreed that projects do not have the time or access to mainframe infrastructure to run mentorships more than once per year.  Friesnegger recommended that Western Students apply for Open Mainframe Project summer mentorships.
