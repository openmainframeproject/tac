Reg Harbeck and Tony Perri spoke about the KhyberPass Password Manager, which is interested in exploring partnership options with The Open Mainframe Project.  John Mertic and Sean Grady identified that the absence of developer resources from The Open Mainframe Project would make a partnership difficult at this time.  Harbeck and Perri were appreciative of the feedback.
