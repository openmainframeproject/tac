# Notes

## COBOL Working Group Update

Jeff Brown said that while the mission remains critical, the group has seen declining participation.  Brown added that the group would like to change the mission of the working group to include all "misfit toys”, - legacy languages still vital to the mainframe ecosystem but often overlooked, such as PL1, Fortran, and Assembler.  

Discussion ensued.  Elizabeth Joseph offered to connect the group with GCC and GNU COBOL contributors to broaden the community tent.  John Mertic suggested that instead of shelving the group, they should focus on technical deliverables and validating interest with these new parties over the next three months. 

## CBT Tape Annual Review

The review will be rescheduled for a future meeting.

## TAC Vice Chair Election

Mike Friesenegger announced that Mark Bylok has nominated himself for TAC Vice Chair.  As there were no other nominees, Bylok is hereby elected as the TAC Vice Chair.  Metric and Tom Slanda will handle Bylok’s onboarding.

## LF Engineering Services

Slanda announced that the OMP has joined the "tiny tier" of LF Engineering Services for fiscal year 2026. Slanda said sub-projects now have access to enterprise-level licenses for GitHub Copilot and GitHub Codespaces.  Slanda added that maintainers interested in these tools should contact Slanda or Mertic to be added to the LF Engineering license list.

## [Sandbox Proposal] AI Dataset Health for z/OS

Mertic said the TAC is waiting for the project lead to confirm that the proposed infrastructure meets their requirements.
