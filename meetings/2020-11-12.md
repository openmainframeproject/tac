## Action Items


## Notes

Thank you @jbostian!

*   Debian is having problems supporting the S390x architecture, and are suggesting dropping support without someone committing to help by November 27
    *   Hardware/platform resources through Marist should be available
    *   Finding an owner is the challenge
    *   Concern about how a lack of Debian support ripples through the larger OS ecosystem
    *   Will impact containerized workloads
    *   John to set up a call with Phlipp Kern, and loop in Len Sanatalucia, David Edelsohn, Ingo Adlung, Joe Bostian
*   Review the Project ambassador Program
    *   Ambassadors should come from each project, and be an integral part of the group
    *   Decided to move ahead, review a set of candidates next month
*   TerseDecompress - reviewed comments from Andrew about remaining involved (he is interested)
*   Github actions for hosted projects is up and running
    *   Polycephaly project is beginning to use for CI/CD
    *   Others are beginning to use
*   Project reviews
    *   Brief reviews from Ambitus, Feilong, GenevaERS, Software Discovery Tool, Polycephaly, Zorow, Mentorship, Zowe
