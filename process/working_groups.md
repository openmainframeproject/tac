The purpose of working groups are to study and report on a particular question and make recommendations based on it's findings. The end result of a working group may be a new project proposal, landscape, whitepaper or even a report detailing it's findings. The intention of working groups is not to host a full project or specification. Working Groups can be formed at any time but must be sponsored by a [TAC member] and with an affirmative vote of the Open Mainframe Project TAC. The TAC can also shut down a working group with a majority vote.

## Process

Working Groups must be proposed via a new [GitHub Issue]. Working Group proposals submitted to the Open Mainframe Project TAC must provide the following information to the best of your ability:

- Working group name
- Describe the purpose of the group in no more that 4-5 sentences.
- Goals of the working group
    - _Goals are the distinct outcomes that is to be anticipated from the working group, serving as a method for validating activities._
- Non-goals of the working group
    - _Non-goals are things that the working group are intentionally choosing not to do, the things not expected to change due to the working groups efforts, or the subject matter areas that the working groups doesnâ€™t want to address at this time. _
- Deliverables
    - _provide a list of planned deliverables, or links to the deliverables. A best practice is to have a directory named deliverables in the repo for hosting and managing deliverables._

Working groups can begin formation to complete the proposal before TAC approval, but will not have official designation as an Open Mainframe Project Working Group until TAC approval. You will also have to present to the Open Mainframe Project TAC and wider community before your WG proposal will be voted upon by the TAC. 

## FAQs

### Q: Who can propose a new working group?
A: Anyone can propose a new working group ( whether from an Open Mainframe Project member organization or not ), but it must be sponsored by a [TAC member].

### Q: Can working groups have infrastructure during formation to enable collaboration?
A: Yes! Please submit a [request on the foundation repo] and we can provide a mailing list, Slack channel, Zoom meeting, and/or GitHub repo as needed. The TAC can also provide additional infrastucture upon request.

### Q: What if the goals or mission of the working group change?
A: The TAC recognizes that in the lifecycle of a working group goals or mission may change. In those cases, the working group must present to the TAC an updated version of their [template] for approval.
