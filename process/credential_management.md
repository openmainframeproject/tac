# Credential Management

In order to maintain all credentials for community resources in a secure manner, the Open Mainframe Project uses [1Password Teams](https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source). This credential store contains usernames and passwords for services such as:

- Zoom
- Build Infrastructure
- Community social accounts

## Access

Access to the primary vault is restricted to TAC/TSC/Working Group chairs only. Project may have additional vaults with project specific credentials that are restricted to only designated individuals by the project's chairperson.

OMP and LF Staff have access to all vaults for the case where project maintainers lose access or are no longer available.

To get access, please [submit a request] for credential access.
