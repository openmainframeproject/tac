## Mainframe Infrastructure Status

Mr. Mertic reported on the status of the Mainframe Infrastructure project.  He said that an SSR will be going on-site to do an evaluation of the mainframe prior to the installation.  He added that an HMC may need to be sourced, depending on the findings of the inspection.


## New Calendar for LFX Meetings 

Mr. Mertic showed the new calendar pages in LFX.  He demonstrated that the calendar will show all scheduled meetings, as well as past meetings and recordings.  He also said this new calendar page will eventually replace the calendar on the mailing list site.

## Review OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Status and LFX Security Usage

Mr. Mertic spoke to recent security events, specifically the xz Backdoor incident.  He reported that due to this incident, the Governing Board has decided on three ways to improve the security posture of our projects. He said they will ensure all projects are current with their OpenSSF badge.  He said they will also start tracking OpenSSF scorecards for all projects.  Lastly, he shared that they will search for other tools that can be made available across projects.
