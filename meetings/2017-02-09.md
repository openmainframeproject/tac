**Presentation on Apache Spark - TSC to review for potential investment**

Mr. Desouza gave an update on Apache Spark. Currently IBM is positioning Apache Spark on z/OS because the data is local to z/OS, but would like to shift that to Linux to align with the Watson ML component.

Feedback from the TSC included:
  * Does TensorFlow require NVIDIA GPUs? Training piece is more efficient with those GPUs, but not a hard requirement

Next steps are for Mr. Desouza to share his slides with the group and discussion offline.
