## **Notes**

**MOE Student User Group** 
Will move this to the next meeting as there was no one to move this to the next meeting

**Ambassador application rankings** 
There was a discussion about the number of new ambassadors that should be accepted. After a consensus, a resolution was presented to accept 10 of the top-ranked applicants. 

-Mr. Bostian presented a motion to accept the new class of Ambassadors. Mr. Frix seconded the motion to approve the new class of Ambassadors and all members were in favor.

**OPEN z/OS Enablement Annual Review**  
Mr. Twitchell advised there is low engagement. Mr. Twitchell asked the group their thoughts on what resources would be needed if the OMP Mainframe took off. The group discussed moving the project to Emeritus Status.

-A motion was made by Mr. Grady to move into an Emeritus status. It was seconded by Mr. Bostian and all members were in favor.

**CD Foundation Best Practices SIG**  
Mr. Mertic reminded the group of the upcoming meeting and invited those interested to attend. 
 
**Zorrow Annual Review** 
Mr. Shah shared that contribution is still slow. IBM is a main contributor and supporter but it remains with low engagement. Mr. Shah asked the TAC what they need to keep the project moving since there is not a lot of contribution. He is interested in maintaining the project space in the event they go into “dormancy” or Emeritus status. Mr. Bostian believes Mr. Shah is headed in the right direction with moving into Emeritus considering the project’s current state.

-Mr. Frix presented a motion to place the Zorrow Project in an Emeritus status. Ms. Srinivasan seconded the motion and all were in favor. 
 



**Project Updates**


**Zowe-** 2.7 will be released next week.  


**Mentorships-** We continue to accept programs for the summer term. Mr. Grady shared that there are several interested and that will be submitting information.
