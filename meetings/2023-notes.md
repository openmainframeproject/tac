## Notes

### Google Season of Docs/Summer of Code #444
    
Projects generally haven't looked at GSoC/GSoD, and don't have bandwidth to do.

### Review Sandbox projects #415

From the previous meeting, TSTerm has issues with ease of adoption ( hard to get people to use the code ). TMZ is easier to get hands-on, but technically inferior. Need to be fixed; a potential idea was to build an electron app to ease usage.

Current TSTerm is stalled on development, but will pick up once brought into Zowe as a dependency. Zowe is planning to integrate this during the next PI as the default terminal emulator for Zowe Desktop. Decided to do next review in June 2023.

Review scheduled in #453
    
z/VM Community Tools no longer has a leader, and TAC considering moving to Emeritus. Will ask Phil Tully about the status, and if not will consider moving to Emeritus. Lionel Dyck indicates tools are still in development, so the need is there. John M indicated just need a leader. Will ask Len S about getting enangement with VM Workshop. Ingo will also follow up.

Review scheduled in #454
    
### Add in Ambassador requirement to participate in one activity per quarter. #413
    
Recommendation was to change to once per half year, otherwise everyone was good with the requirements. 

TAC approved - motion @Sudharsana-Srinivasan second Greg MacKinnon. Unanimously approved.
    
### Call for Ambassadors and renewal of existing ambassadors #405

Agreed to close new nominations, John M to provide list of applicant in a Google Sheet for the TAC to review and rank.
    
### Discuss Mainframe Project Onboarding Process #399

John M to pull group together to work on seperately.    

### Project updates
    
- COBOL Programming Course - had first monthly call, working on focuses for 2023 and planning Q1 TSC call. Will be bringing in COBOL Check to potentially integrate into the course 
- GenevaERS - began testing MR91 on mainframe, replaces partial C++ component. Tech writer has had a job change so that work is paused; doing knowledge transfer to others.
- Zowe - [PI planning this week](https://github.com/zowe/community/tree/master/Project%20Management/PI%20Planning/23PI1%20Planning). Documentation focus for z/OS native code from relevant squads. Zowe 2.6 to release next week; server code will be able to load configuration from different sources, adding documentation for getting Zowe extensions from package managers such as npm.
- CBT Tape - working on mirroring to GitHub. 
- Software Discovery Tool - Added updates for latest SUSE, Fedora release. Interest from IBM POWER team using the tool.
- Zorow - No updates; do know of usage of z/OSMF workflows being used, but they are specialized and not likely to be contributed. Continue to advocate.
- Linux Distributions WG - Talk at FOSDEM around collaboration across distros.
- Modernization WG - monthly meetings, focused on getting organized, how to produce documentation, and work together.

## **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Notes</span>**


**CD Foundation Best Practices SIG:**  
The initial meeting was held on Jan 25, 2023, with CD Foundation attendees + people from Google, Netflix, Splunk, MongoDB. The CDF goal is to: ‚Äúnormalize‚Äù terminology, focus on the abstraction of tech/tools, and identify and document best practices.

The Open Mainframe Project strategy (Zowe) was well received. The next steps include developing a Whitepaper, and providing access to the mainframe sandbox environment.

Call-to-action - In need of balanced participation from the mainframe ecosystem in the SIG discussions.

More information can be found: at [https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-best-practices](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-best-practices)

**Ambassadors**:  
Some TAC voting members still need to vote. It was decided to wait until the next TAC meeting in order to obtain more votes. Reminders will be sent to those who have not voted.

**ADE and COBOL Check Annual Reviews:**
These will have to be rescheduled. Ms. Kilborn will work will the leads. 


**Mainframe Project Onboarding Process:**

A group has been meeting to establish the process and resources/configurations for the mainframe. The TAC asked about the use, whether commercial or educational. Mr. Mertic mentioned it would not be commercial and it would likely be primarily like a CI/CD environment. Start with the most common use case. Mr. Dahlberg has some questions and will connect with Ms. Srinivasan for some clarification. An LPAR around education may be needed. 
 
Each project would have to provide a report at the end of the year.

This group meets weekly and members are welcome to join. 
 


**Project Updates:**

**COBOL Programming Course:** Ms. Srinivasan said they are meeting with COBOL Check to see if they can move ahead with debugging and testing. Mr. Bauer mentioned they continue to get more people registering and consuming the course.

**Zowe:**
Mr. Grady announced a new Event Management working group exploring the boosting of event management for Zowe. It is in its early stages to see what technology is needed to be successful. They meet Tuesdays at 10 am EST if anyone is interested and has ideas to contribute. 
 
**Open Mainframe Education**: Ms. Joseph mentioned they are still considering the mentorship program for the summer term, but they are a little tight with their resources.

 
**Tessia**: Mr. Efremkin mentioned being interested in being a use case as an infrastructure tool on the Mainframe.

**Cobol Working Group:** Sarah attended Fosdem (a video is available online) and mentioned there is a group that may be interested in joining.

## **Notes**

**MOE Student User Group** 
Will move this to the next meeting as there was no one to move this to the next meeting

**Ambassador application rankings** 
There was a discussion about the number of new ambassadors that should be accepted. After a consensus, a resolution was presented to accept 10 of the top-ranked applicants. 

-Mr. Bostian presented a motion to accept the new class of Ambassadors. Mr. Frix seconded the motion to approve the new class of Ambassadors and all members were in favor.

**OPEN z/OS Enablement Annual Review**  
Mr. Twitchell advised there is low engagement. Mr. Twitchell asked the group their thoughts on what resources would be needed if the OMP Mainframe took off. The group discussed moving the project to Emeritus Status.

-A motion was made by Mr. Grady to move into an Emeritus status. It was seconded by Mr. Bostian and all members were in favor.

**CD Foundation Best Practices SIG**  
Mr. Mertic reminded the group of the upcoming meeting and invited those interested to attend. 
 
**Zorrow Annual Review** 
Mr. Shah shared that contribution is still slow. IBM is a main contributor and supporter but it remains with low engagement. Mr. Shah asked the TAC what they need to keep the project moving since there is not a lot of contribution. He is interested in maintaining the project space in the event they go into ‚Äúdormancy‚Äù or Emeritus status. Mr. Bostian believes Mr. Shah is headed in the right direction with moving into Emeritus considering the project‚Äôs current state.

-Mr. Frix presented a motion to place the Zorrow Project in an Emeritus status. Ms. Srinivasan seconded the motion and all were in favor. 
 



**Project Updates**


**Zowe-** 2.7 will be released next week.

## Notes 
**Modernization Working Group:** 

Ms. Decker presented the annual review for the Modernization Working Group. She noted that they agreed on a definition as an achievement for the group. She said the next steps are to build out a repository, which may cause a modification of the definition. Ms. Decker said they are also determining a location for the repository and then taking nominations for content. Once all nominations have been received, there will be a vote.

Due to a lack of quorum, a vote to renew will be sent to voting TAC members via email.

 
**TSTerm Annual Review:** 

Mr. Devlin presented the review for TSTTerm. He said they are using the electron packaging to make a standalone version so that it can be adopted as the terminal on the Zowe desktop and for use on other Zowe products.  He said other targets for adoptions are getting some of the mainframe education programs associated with the Open Mainframe Project using TSTERM. Mr. Devlin said they are in need of a UI Engineer. Mr. Devlin demonstrated an executable that the project has been working on.

Mr. Grady commented that since the last review, there has been progress that the hard part has been completed and that there is an executable. He said with more people, the project could possibly do more.

Due to a lack of quorum, a vote to renew will be sent to voting TAC members via email.

**z/VM Tools Community Tools:**

Mr. Mertic spoke about the project and how the leadership has changed several times. He stated the most recent project lead passed away, and there is currently no one leading it.  He asked the TAC members in attendance for their thoughts on whether to move the project into Emeritus status or look to the community for interest in leadership. The TAC discussed this, and all agreed that the project should be promoted within the Z community worldwide to find interest before moving it to Emeritus status. Mr. Dyck agreed to work with Mr. Santalucia on listing this to try and find interest.

**Meeting Management-** Mr. Mertic said most projects have transitioned to the LFX meeting management tool. Ms. Joseph and Ms.Srinivasan said they would try it with their projects and upcoming meetings. Mr. Bostian commented that he has had a positive experience and likes it better than his previous method of hosting meetings. Mr. Grady mentioned his delay in fully transitioning has been due to having to add people manually from GitHub to the different committees and groups. Mr. Mertic said this is a feature the LFX team has noted as something to improve for the future.

**Open Telemetry-** Mr. Mertic provided an update and said they are getting close to presenting a plan before the committee.

**Mainframe-** Mr.Devlin asked for a brief update. Mr. Santalucia summarized everything that has been done and said the agreement is close to being finalized, and they are progressing with the mainframe implementation.

# Notes


  **CD Foundation Best Practices SIG ([https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/460](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/460))-** 

Mr. Mertic provided an update and said the SIG has stalled out, and there have not been any real changes or progress. Mr. Mertic said he would reach out for more information. 

**OpenTelemetry SIG formation [#535]([https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/535](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/535))**

Mr. Mertic said the group plans to kick the SIG off after the new year. This working group is centered around z/OS and Z Linux. He told the TAC to visit the issue if anyone was interested in signing up.

**Review OpenSSF Best Practices badge status and LFX Security usage for projects [#541]([https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/541](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/541))**

Mr. Mertic reviewed the list of projects and their stage within the OpenSSF badge certification process. He said a big focus during his project check-ins in the new year will be centered around this.

Mr. Mertic spoke about LFX Security and reminded the TAC of the features and the value. 

**2024 Ambassador Selections #590** 

The remainder of the meeting was centered around the Ambassador applications. The TAC members in attendance reviewed the list of applicants.

Ms. Srinivasan suggested selecting ambassadors scoring 18 as it would represent half of the applicants, and it would also add  ‚Äúrigor.‚Äù  There was a discussion with the TAC members in attendance weighing the pros and cons and the individual applicants ranking between 18 and 15 and whether to extend the cutoff to 15.

Because there was not a quorum, the vote will be done via email. Ms. Kilborn will send the vote to the TAC voting members to ask about the cutoff at 15 vs.18 by way of the new LFX voting system.
