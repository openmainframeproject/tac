# Compliance engine

## Description
Provide a compliance engine where humans can input rules and the compliance engine will check whether blockchain records conform to those rules.

## Additional Information
Work to be done would be:
- Integration with a rules engine, for example: IBM's Operational Decision Manager (ODM) – extend and modify the Compliance engine to leverage ODM for rule definition and Rule execution.
- Data aggregations – extend and modify the Compliance engine to provide statistical data aggregation functions – functions which will allow to either statistically aggregate asset data prior rule checking or to statistically aggregate results of rule checking post analysis for reporting purposes.
- Scalability - extend and modify the Compliance engine to leverage Spark (or other cluster computing framework) to allow processing of large data sets and large sets of rules.

## Desirable Skills
*List both the skills needed and the tools to be used. ie. Java programing with working knowledge of mainframe.*

## Expected Outcome

## Difficultly
*Easy/Medium/Hard*

## Mentors
  * Donna N Dillenberger <engd@us.ibm.com>

## Additional Contacts
*Identify the IRC channel(s) and mailing list(s) where potential interns can ask questions and further interact with members of Open Mainframe Project project they would be working with.*
