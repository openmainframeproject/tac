# Open Mainframe Project Top Level Project Proposal Process

Based on the [CNCF Project Proposal Process v1.1](https://github.com/CNCF/toc/blob/40abe6f81c2b46842a87d6c47cf4190f0d8c1856/process/project_proposals.adoc)

## Introduction

This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the Open Mainframe Project. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into the OMP, and new projects to be formed within the Open Mainframe Project.

## Project Proposal Requirements

Projects must be proposed via pull request to [../projects](GitHub). Project proposals submitted to the Open Mainframe Project must provide the following information to the best of your ability:

* Name of project (must be unique within Open Mainframe Project)
* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)
* Statement on alignment with Open Mainframe Project charter mission
* Are there similar/releated projects in the out there? If so, what is different about this project?
* Sponsor from TSC (sponsor helps mentor projects)
* Preferred maturity level (see [project stages](project_stages.md)))
* License and contribution guidelines (charter dictates [Apache 2](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html) by default except for Linux kernel code which must be [GPLv2](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-2.0), having each committer agree to the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/)
* Source control (GitHub by default)
* External dependencies (including licenses)
* Initial committers (how long working on project)
* Infrastructure requests (CI / OMP Cluster)
* Communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)
* Issue tracker (GitHub by default)
* Website
* Release methodology and mechanics
* Social media accounts
* Community size and any existing sponsorship

## Project Acceptance Process

* Projects are required to present their proposal at a TSC meeting
* Projects get accepted via a 2/3 supermajority vote of the TSC
* All projects must adopt the Open Mainframe Project [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
* All projects agree to transfer any relevant trademarks to the Open Mainframe Project and to assist in filing for any relevant unregistered ones. This assignment will be reversed if the project does not remain in the Open Mainframe Project, as described below. Note that no patent or copyright assignment is necessary because the [Apache 2](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html) license provides sufficient protections for other developers and users.
* All projects start at the Incubation stage by default unless the TSC approves otherwise.
