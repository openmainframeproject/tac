### Notes

-**Open Mainframe Summit update-** The call for papers deadline is 2022-06-10. The event will be hybrid and speakers can apply to speak virtually.


-Mr. Phil Tully has left ADP and there is now a vacant seat for the TAC seat. If someone is interested in filling that role, please let us know.

-Mr. Bruce Hayden **z/VM Community Tools annual review.** There have been some meetings to discuss the direction of the project. Mr. Moling also attended and mentioned some struggles with the project. They are looking to develop a format for information about the tool and where to host the information and list of tools and where to maintain. Github seems to be a good option but would be a learning curve. Mr. Twitchell said they are in the process of developing a tool set that would allow them to interact with Github. Mr. Moling said they would look to do the same.

-Ambitus will present their annual review in July with the hopes of moving out of the sandbox stage. 

-Mr. Metric provided a presentation on **“Scaling up.”** He highlighted Kubernetes as an example project that has been successful at doing this. There are tools available to assist such as LF Insights that can help. He recommended building contributor’s guides for those who may not know how to engage. Some projects have office hours, mentorship programs. It is also important to recognize contributors. Projects should have a “getting started guide” with perhaps videos. Outreach is another tactic. Training is an important part of scaling up. The LF can help partner with projects on training and certification programs. Ms. Joseph mentioned she is currently creating issues to create a contributor guide for her program. Mr. Shah said he’s seen some companies who don’t allow their employees to to contribute code while employed with and Mr. Mertic said he has seen this quite a bit. Case studies and end-user studies are an important part to help other end users in their decision-making.
