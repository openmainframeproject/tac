## Notes

There was discussion on moving Cloudstack on z/VM to Emeritus status - all generally agreed. Next step is to conduct vote via email. There was additional discussion on having the existing community migrate to the z/VM Cloud Connector project. John Mertic offered to do an email for this once the vote for Emeritus status is complete.

Bob Dahlberg indicated that he's working on a number of operational updates for the internship program, including moving to Github and establishing an intern guide. He further said that he will start working on past intern blog posts with Mae for promotion of the program.

John Mertic indicated that the Zowe update was sent via [email](https://lists.openmainframeproject.org/g/omp-tsc/topic/i_ll_miss_the_tsc_today/27402147?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,2,0,27402147)

John Mertic indicated that z/VM Cloud Connector was accepted at the Incubation level, and right now they are working on cleaning up the license attributions in the code base and finalizing the governance stucture before bringing the code over and formally announcing the project.

John Mertic indicated that the Supported Projects Program is now live. Dave Jones volunteered to help mentor projects needing mainframe support. Mike Friesenegger and Neale Ferguson were both wanting to build out a larger list of open source projects and resources for the community with this page.
