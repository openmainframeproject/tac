Inconsistent across distros:

zeroinstall-injector ( aka 0install )
https://github.com/0install

ClefOS - 0install-2.11-1.el7.s390x
openSUSE - zeroinstall-injector
Fedora Rawhide - not built

dpdk - Broken all distros, but seems to have build instructions ( https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z/docs/wiki/Building-DPDK )
- https://mails.dpdk.org/archives/dev/2019-April/129880.html
- Needs arch specific compiler code
* Possible good one, needs input from Enyu/Cindy on the status

sysdig - doesn't build on openSUSE, error:

nothing provides kernel-zfcpdump-devel = 5.0.7-1 needed by kernel-syms

* Work being done in community, will provide CI infra once Marist infrastructure

memcached
