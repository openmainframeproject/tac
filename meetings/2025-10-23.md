# Notes

## General Updates

## AI Dataset Health for z/OS

Marcelo Silveira presented the new project proposal for AI Dataset Health for z/OS.  Due to the projectâ€™s requirement of access to a z/OSMF endpoint, the TAC decided to delay a vote until the requested resources are available.

## Mentorship Program 2026 strategy

Mike Friesenegger opened a discussion regarding the annual mentorship program and addressing the feedback provided by the mentors.  Discussion ensued, and the group agreed to continue to support and promote the mentorship program.

## Discuss interest in creating a Security WG

John Mertic recapped the presentation provided by CRobb and OpenSSF best practices.  Friesenegger added that TAC members could speak to security-focused individuals in their organizations regarding the Open Mainframe Project and OpenSSF and seeing if they would be interested in contributing.
