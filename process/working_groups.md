The purpose of working groups is to study and report on a particular question and make recommendations based on its findings. The end result of a working group may be a new project proposal, landscape, whitepaper ,or even a report detailing its findings. The intention of working groups is not to host a full project or specification. Working Groups can be formed at any time but must be sponsored by a [TAC member] and with an affirmative vote of the Open Mainframe Project TAC. The TAC can also shut down a working group with a majority vote.

## Process

Working Groups must be proposed via a new [GitHub Issue]. Working Group proposals submitted to the Open Mainframe Project TAC must provide the following information to the best of your ability:

- Working group name
- Describe the purpose of the group in no more than 4-5 sentences.
- Goals of the working group
    - _Goals are the distinct outcomes that are to be anticipated from the working group, serving as a method for validating activities._
- Non-goals of the working group
    - _Non-goals are things that the working group is intentionally choosing not to do, the things not expected to change due to the working group's efforts, or the subject matter areas that the working groups don’t want to address at this time. _
- Deliverables
    - _provide a list of planned deliverables or links to the deliverables. A best practice is to have a directory named deliverables in the repo for hosting and managing deliverables._

Working groups can begin formation to complete the proposal before TAC approval, but will not have the official designation as an Open Mainframe Project Working Group until TAC approval. You will also have to present to the Open Mainframe Project TAC and the wider community before your WG proposal will be voted upon by the TAC. 

## Benefits

Working groups are able to leverage the shared infrastructure of the Open Mainframe Project for collaboration, including wiki space, mailing lists, Slack channel, Zoom meetings, and/or GitHub repo as needed. Please submit a [request on the foundation repo] to enable these services. The TAC can also provide the additional infrastructure upon request. More details on other benefits [here](project_benefits_by_stage).

## Working Group review

The TAC will review on an annual basis all working groups. The purpose of the TAC Review is to gauge the status of the working group achieving the items outlined in it's charter. 

Working groups will schedule their annual review as part of the next TAC meeting following the anniversary of the project’s acceptance. Working groups should prepare a short presentation that covers the following points, which the TAC will use in its review of the working group:

- The current activity of the working group.
- Assessment of whether the working group has achieved it's goals and/or needs to redefine it's charter.
- Feedback on its experience as an Open Mainframe Project working group, including benefits from being an Open Mainframe Project working group and areas that the TAC and Open Mainframe Project staff can better support the working group.

Annual reviews require a majority affirmative vote of the TAC for the working group to continue. If the TAC deems the working group to not be on track for completing the goals outlined in it's charter, it may request to have the working group disbanded. The working group may choose to move outside of the Open Mainframe Project at any time.

## FAQs

### Q: Who can propose a new working group?
A: Anyone can propose a new working group ( whether from an Open Mainframe Project member organization or not ), but it must be sponsored by a [TAC member].

### Q: What if the goals or mission of the working group change?
A: The TAC recognizes that in the lifecycle of a working group goals or mission may change. In those cases, the working group must present to the TAC an updated version of their [template] for approval.
