*   Each project area team needs to review the spreadsheet of applicants in their area in the Google Doc folder link above.   Review the candidates, work with them to determine which candidate(s) you’d like to work with and on which project.  
*   The Mentorship committee (of which every mentor is a member) will decide which projects we will sponsor and which candidates will become mentees.  
*   All applicants need to be interviewed and rated before May 15th.
