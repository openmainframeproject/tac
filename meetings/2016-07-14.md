**Update on open source project list**

Cindy Lee provided Mr. Mertic the following update via email as she was
unable to attend the meeting:

"The package distro searching tool (IBM internal use only) has info from
3 distros now and I would like to get legal clearance on whether I\'m
allowed to re-distribute package list info for at least 1 before I
proceed with externalizing the tool or open sourcing it. I got in touch
with all 3 distros and my latest updates are:

-   RHEL: Got a NO from them

-   SLES: Has been talking to Mike Friesenegger from your group and have
    good conversation but Mike is away now. Will book a meeting with him
    once he become available.

-   Ubuntu: Have email exchange and sounds positive but still waiting
    for an official answer from them."
