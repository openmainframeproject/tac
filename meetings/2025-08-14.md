# Notes

## General Updates

## Zorse Annual Review

Gabriel Gordon-Hall presented the annual review for Zorse.  Gordon-Hall recommended archiving the project, as he no longer has the resources to move it forward.  Discussion ensued, and the TAC agreed to socialize with the community at the SHARE event next week in hopes of finding new maintainers.  Mike Friesenegger recommended revisiting the item in a monthâ€™s time.  

## Feilong Annual Review

Friesenegger presented the annual review for Feilong.  Per the new project renewal process, Feilong was automatically renewed at its current level.
