# Notes

## General Updates

* Discontinue community.openmainframeproject.org
    * The Governing Board is requesting the TAC’s feedback regarding shutting down the site and moving the conversations to Slack.
    * Tom Slanda volunteered to create a poll in LFX, as well as creating a decommissioning plan

* GSE UK Virtual Conference 2025
* IBM TechXchange 2025

## zOpen Annual Review

Igor Todorovski presented the zOpen Annual Review.

A renewal vote will take place offline in LFX.

## Strategy Session

Mike Friesenegger suggested selecting 2-3 brainstorming items to focus on and discuss further.  John Mertic added that a mainframe industry group on using and promoting SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) is in motion and should be selected.  Sean Grady voiced support for the item “developing an AI chatbot for project documentation”.

Igor Todorovski asked if the Open Mainframe Project’s Slack workspace was active, as it was his experience that the System Z Enthusiasts Discord server is more popular.  Grady added that Slack’s short message history has been pushing more users to Discord.  Donna Hudi said that the System Z Enthusiasts Discord server is maintained by an individual, and as such, it could be removed or shut down at the whim of the individual.  Mertic added most projects are deterred from using the Enterprise tier of Slack (which includes message history) due to the substantial cost.
