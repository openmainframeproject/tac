# Open Mainframe Project community collaboration tools

Open Mainframe Project maintains a number of tools to enable collaboration amongst community participants. To help navigate these tools, this document provides a brief outline of how to use them and best practices.

## Slack

Open Mainframe Project hosts a Slack organization, which can be joined using the SlackIn joiner at https://slack.openmainframeproject.org. 

## Mailing lists

Open Mainframe Project maintains a number of mailing lists for the foundation itself, it's members, and the community at large. These mailing lists are hosted at [groups.io](https://groups.io) and managed by the Linux Foundation staff and Open Mainframe Project community leadership.

### Key mailing lists

The primary mailing list for all techincal community discussion is [omp-technical@lists.openmainframeproject.org](https://lists.openmainframeproject.org/g/omp-technical). Each hosted project and working group has it's own mailing list as well, which are [listed in the project listing in the TAC repo](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac#tac-projects).

### Moderation and Moderation Guidelines

By default, TSC voting members serve as the moderator for discussions in [omp-technical@lists.openmainframeproject.org](https://lists.openmainframeproject.org/g/omp-technical), and each hosted project's TSC will serve as moderator for it's mailing lists. Moderation privledges can be extended to others upon a vote by the TAC or respective TSC as applicable.

Being a moderator is as much a privledge as it is a duty. As part of volunteering to become a moderator you are now a representative of the Open Mainframe Project community, and it is your responsibility to remain aware of your contributions in this space. These responsibilities apply to all official Open Mainframe Project channels.

Moderators MUST:

- Take action as specified by these Moderator Guidelines.
  - You are empowered to take immediate action when there is a violation. You do not need to wait for review or approval if an egregious violation has occurred. Make a judgement call based on our Code of Conduct and Values (see below).
  - Removing a bad actor or content from the medium is required, do NOT let it sit there.
- Abide by the documented tasks and actions required of moderators.
- Ensure that the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) is in effect on all official Open Mainframe Project channels.
- Make yourself generally available during working hours in your time zone for moderation. This can be handled as a group so that there is enough coverage of people to allow for absences/travel.
- Take care of spam as soon as possible, which may mean taking action by removing a member from that resource.
- Foster a safe and productive environment by being aware of potential multiple cultural differences between community members.
- Understand that you might be contacted by moderators, community managers, and other users via private email or a direct message.
- Keep up with software/platform changes on the property they are responsible for. This might include new UI changes, new features, or other software changes. Moderators are encouraged to meet regularly to train themselves how to be proficient with the platform.
- Report violations of the Code of Conduct to pm@openmainframeproject.org.

Moderators SHOULD:

- Exercise compassion and empathy when communicating and collaborating with other community members.
- Understand the difference between a user abusing the resource or just having difficulty expressing comments and questions in English.
- Be an example and role model to others in the community. In many cases, moderators are some of the first people new contributors will interact with.
- Remember to check and recognize if you need take a break when you become frustrated or find yourself in a heated debate.
- Help your colleagues if you recognize them in one of the stages of burnout.
- Be helpful and have fun!

### Mailing list best practices

- Review your mailing list subscriptions regularly, and either change the delivery mechanism ( such as switching from indivudual emails to daily digests ) as it makes sense to keep the signal-to-noise level reasonable for you.
- Keep your comments and conversation on topic
- Recognize with a global community and other obligations, replies aren't instantaneous.
  - Refrain from cross-posting as a way to get a larger audience to your post.
- Be sure to contact the list moderators if there are any Code of Conduct concerns.

## Calendars

You can stay subscribed to the meetings of the projects and committees of the Open Mainframe Project by subscribing to the coordinating mailing list. Each mailing list has a calendar which you can subscribe to you with your calendar client of choice.

### Calendar management best practices

- Do ensure that any meeting invites have clearly idenified web conference or location details.
  - Unless the meeting is only in person, always provide a web conference for those who can't attend in person
- Be sure the description of the meeting has an agenda or a link to the agenda of the meeting.
- Since calendaring clients can not always be good at managing changes...
  - If a meeting is to be rescheduled, delete the original meeting invite and add a new one with a title denoting it being rescheduled.
  - Avoid cancelling meetings within 24 hours of the meeting
  - For changes/cancellations, email the invitees as well to inform them of the cancellation
  - When provisioning a new series of recurring meetings, instruct invites to remove old entries manually.
