# Badging Program

Open Mainframe Project hosted projects and working groups can issue badges through [Credly](https://credly.com) at no cost. Badges are a great way to showcase leaders in a community or achievements made. Some ideas for badges include:

- Project maintainers/committers
- Event speaker
- Completing a program

You can view the current list of badges issued by the Open Mainframe Project [on Credly](https://www.credly.com/organizations/the-linux-foundation/collections/open-mainframe-project/badge_templates).
