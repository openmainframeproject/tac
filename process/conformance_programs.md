While usage of an open source project in a commercial downstream project is governing by the project's license, we often see that open source projects look to define a more succinct ecosystem of products where the project is used in a way that promotes interoperability. There exists many examples of this within the Linux Foundation and beyond.

The general considerations and approaches recommended by the Linux Foundation are outlined in this [blog post](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/blog/driving-compatibility-with-code-and-specifications-through-conformance-trademark-programs/)

This page provides an overview of how Open Mainframe Project hosted projects can form a program and the benefits as provided by the Open Mainframe Project.

# Requirements for Open Mainframe Project hosted projects

Open Mainframe Project will support projects at the 'Graduated' level in the creation of a conformance program. Projects at other stages may be considered at the discretion of the TAC.

# Benefits provided from Open Mainframe Project

- Creation of a conformance badge and branding guide.
- Creation of a conformance landing page and directory, leveraging the Open Mainframe Landscape as a data source.
- Open Mainframe Project staff will review and process all conformance applications in confidence and review them in an objective manner per the requirements defined by the project community.
