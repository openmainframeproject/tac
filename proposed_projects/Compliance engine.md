# Compliance engine

## Description
Provide a compliance engine where humans can input rules and the compliance engine will check whether blockchain records conform to those rules.

## Additional Information
Work to be done would be:
- Integration with a rules engine, for example: IBM's Operational Decision Manager (ODM) – extend and modify the Compliance engine to leverage ODM for rule definition and Rule execution.
- Data aggregations – extend and modify the Compliance engine to provide statistical data aggregation functions – functions which will allow to either statistically aggregate asset data prior rule checking or to statistically aggregate results of rule checking post analysis for reporting purposes.
- Scalability - extend and modify the Compliance engine to leverage Spark (or other cluster computing framework) to allow processing of large data sets and large sets of rules.
