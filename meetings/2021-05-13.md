## Action Items


## Notes


*   Second monthly meeting of TAC to be on 4th thursday of the month

     z/VM community tools discussion



*   Tools exist for z/VM but are scattered
    *   Primarily, zVM development website ([www.vm.ibm.com](www.vm.ibm.com))
        *   Many tools, but some tools old enough that they may not work as originally intended
    *   Secondarily, VM Workshop ([www.vmworkshop.org](www.vmworkshop.org))
        *   All-volunteer group 
    *   Sine Nomine, Marist College, and some github content also around
*   Due to scattered nature, desire to put them somewhere unified so that they won’t get lost to time
*   If unified as a focal point in OMP, can a community form, with collab for new tools over time
    *   Improved testing due to awareness in a central place
        *   Can do validation of compatibility of tools with releases of zVM and show these results in an organized manner
    *   Focus: just tools that run on z/VM or are about z/VM
*   Concerns
    *   Being unable to contact owners? At least could provide a lexicon of the locations of tools. Ideally, offer to host the tools so that things don’t remain lost or obscure.
    *   Licensing: Ability to be flexible, but OSI-compliant is best. Some tools could have no license to begin with.
*   Project approved at “sandbox” level.

    Lfx chat



*   Open to all with an LF account, so basically open to everyone.
*   Channels are created on request at this time
*   No bots or messages migrated at this time
    *   Research to be done about if chatbots can be migrated or created
*   Idea to move some conversations over to lfx chat for getting the ball rolling… How about zowe-tsc?

    Incubation renewal - Software Discovery Tool



*   Slow start but recent progress
    *   Completed fork, migrated from python 2 to 3
*   Part of upcoming mentorship
*   Roadmap
    *   UI improvements
    *   (JSON api improvements? Didnt capture)
*   Incubation graduation plans?
    *   Determining where to go & what to be in the long run with regards to goals when considering that there are starting to be other tools that have similar missions/technologies
*   Incubation renewal approved
