## Notes 
**Mentorship Program Submissions** [[#629](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/629)] 

Mr. Mertic spoke about the Summer Mentorship program and stated the window for submissions is open. Ms. Ortiz provided the link to the submission form: [https://forms.gle/mMsVyomi7FKpre3eA](https://forms.gle/mMsVyomi7FKpre3eA) as well as a mentor guide.

**Review OpenSSF Best Practices badge status and LFX Security usage for projects**[[#541](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/541)]

Mr. Mertic gave an update on the OpenSSF Best Practices badge for projects. He mentioned there is still a lot of work to be done with projects in the incubation level and that the focus over the next few weeks will be clean up work.

**Mainframe resource coming online status [[#596](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/596)]** 
Mr. Mertic updated the TAC on the Mainframe and said the hope is to have it active by the summer. He said all of the necessary agreements have been agreed to and that they are working on getting them executed in order to get it all going.

**CLOTributor for Open Mainframe Project [[#620](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/620)]** 

Mr. Mertic introduced CLOTributor, a product from CNCF. He said it works by searching through GitHub issues and pulling any that are tagged, “help wanted”  and adds them to list, so people can go find them. He said this allows for greater visibility for people looking to contribute.

 
**Add reinstatement policy to Ambassador program [[#631](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/pull/631)]** 

Mr. Mertic, reviewed a new policy for Ambassadors if there is a lapse in their contributions. He outlined the requirements and said Ambassadors can be reinstated,  by participating in at least one Open Mainframe Project asset per half year ( Jan-June, July-Dec ). 

**Examples include:**


- Submitting a blog post for the Open Mainframe website
- Participating in an interview (TechStrong TV, TFIR, or other)
- Submitting a speaking abstract on behalf of the project
- Speaking at a conference or tradeshow
- Leading a meetup
- Speaking at a webinar

Failure to do so may result in removal from the Ambassador Program. If an ambassador is removed from the program due to inactivity, they can be reinstated after participating in an asset in both of the periods following their removal. If the ambassador does not complete the reinstatement process, they can become an ambassador again by re-applying.

The TAC voting members in attendance agreed with the new policy however due to no quorum, Ms. Ortiz will send a vote via LFX.

**New Project Proposal - z/OS Open Tools [[#625](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/625)]**

Mr. Todorovski presented the z/OS Tools project. Mr. Grady had questions regarding the package manager and a discussion ensued. Mr. Bostian noted looking forward to the vote, which will be sent via LFX.

There being no further business, the meeting adjourned at 1:43 p.m.
