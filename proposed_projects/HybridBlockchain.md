# Hybrid Blockchain

## Description
The project is focusing on inclusion of external parties in the creation and verification of transactions and ledger, without full participation of the parties in the blockchain network. These features preserve data privacy while allow for higher scalability and performance of the network and of the connected systems.

## Additional information

Work to be done would be:

- The goal is to develop prototypes of several features in Go language.

- Extend the architecture and consensus model of Fabric with cryptographic protocol allowing inclusion of external parties in creation of the ledger.

- Extend the architecture and consensus model of Fabric to include external endorsing parties based on type and content of transactions.


## Desirable Skills
High familiarity with blockchain concepts, especially in the area of consensus and transaction processing protocols. Familiarity with the Hyperledger Fabric preferred. Familiarity with cryptographic concepts such as PKI and hashing algorithms, and with networking protocols. Background in computer programming required. Background and familiarity with data science concepts and tooling (Golang, Mocking) preferred but not required.

## Expected Outcome
A prototype implementation of the Hybrid Blockchain features. The work should lead to a high quality research publication.
