# Notes

## COBOL Check

Mark Bylok and John Mertic to discuss next week.

## COBOL Working Group

Jeff Brown provided an update from the COBOL Working Group.  Brown said a survey will be conducted to gather community feedback and strategic planning will follow based on the results.

Mike Friesenegger suggested scheduling an update for the 2/12/2026 TAC meeting.

## TAC Vice Chair Election

John Mertic reported that the TAC is in need of a Vice Chair nominee.  

## Mainframe Infrastructure Status

Mertic summarized the latest items regarding the IBM Mainframe resources.  Mertic said there will be requirements, such as user agreements, for all users.

Mertic added that infrastructure requests can be made via GitHub Issue.

## Adding Community Elected Representatives Roles

Mertic said that Friesenegger was elected as an Industry Representative.

## LF Engineering Services

Tom Slanda reported that the Governing Board approved an increased spend with the Linux Foundation’s Engineering Services team, which will give sub-projects access to certain GitHub Enterprise features.  Slanda requested that the TAC discuss the rules and requirements for sub-projects to apply for and use these new features.  

Discussion ensued, and Slanda volunteered to research processes and procedures used by other Linux Foundation projects.

## Always thinking about project security

Friesenegger communicated the importance of security best practices, including pull request reviews and OpenSSF badges.
