_This document is intended to be a template for working groups established by the TAC, to be used as the README.md file in its repository. All items in italics are descriptions of what context should be there; it is intended to be replaced by content. It is modeled off the [CNCF Serverless WG](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless)._

_The intention is that each WG has its own GitHub repo under the [Open Mainframe Project organization](https://github.com/openmainframeproject)._

# _Working group name_

_Describe the group's purpose in at most 4-5 sentences._

_Goals are the distinct outcomes that are to be anticipated from the working group, serving as a method for validating activities._

The goals of the WG are:

1. _goal 1_
2. ...

_Non-goals are things that the working group intentionally chooses not to do, things not expected to change due to the working group's efforts, or the subject matter areas that the working group doesnâ€™t want to address._

Non-goals of the WG are:

1. _non-goal 1_
2. ...

The TAC member sponsor of this working group is _TAC sponsor's name._

## Deliverables

_Provide a list of planned deliverables or links to the deliverables. A best practice is to have a directory named [deliverables](deliverables) in the repo for hosting and managing deliverables._

## Communication

This WG communicates on the following channels:

- _link to the mailing list_
- _slack channel_
- _any other channels_
  ...
