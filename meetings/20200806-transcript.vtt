00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:20.940
Len Santalucia: Yeah.

4
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.770
Len Santalucia: Like forever.

5
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.130
Vincent Terrone: Hey line. Can you hear me.

6
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:35.880
John Mertic: I can hear you.

7
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.910
Vincent Terrone: Okay, good. That's good. It's also, can you hear me.

8
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.710
Vincent Terrone: Thank you. I just my Bluetooth bass down

9
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.630
No worries.

10
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.760
Vincent Terrone: Okay. How you doing,

11
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.820
Vincent Terrone: Doing well. Yeah.

12
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.290
Vincent Terrone: Yeah yeah

13
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.350
John Mertic: Winding down with summer here.

14
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.890
Vincent Terrone: Now, I just finished my I was teaching cobalt

15
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.970
Vincent Terrone: For like a mini session. And I just finished yesterday.

16
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:14.010
Vincent Terrone: Awesome I in five weeks. These kids wrote a Kobo well I mean they stole code from quote well but they did write something

17
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:15.600
Vincent Terrone: So,

18
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.300
Vincent Terrone: That was an accomplishment.

19
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.890
John Mertic: Yes, definitely. Did you use some of the training course materials.

20
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:33.900
Vincent Terrone: I use. So what I did was I use IBM cobalt class that they have for the slides because they actually had slides, but I use you guys for the lab. So all

21
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:42.540
Vincent Terrone: These labs every single lab that you guys had they did, I did a bit different orders, but they did all the labs and they use them.

22
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:53.790
Vincent Terrone: You know, the way you guys set it up with Visual Studio Code, which was phenomenal. Because if I had to teach him 30 to 70. I mean, you know, that's a, that's a few hours.

23
00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:08.910
Vincent Terrone: Yeah, it was so easy. I mean, they all were hooked up within like you know like you know 1520 minutes. Everyone was working on it. So that was great. Yeah, it was really, really good awesome thing.

24
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.830
John Mertic: That's, that's great to hear. Yeah, that might be

25
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:19.740
John Mertic: Yeah, maybe at some point. If you're interested, you could probably even do some sort of like a blog post and just sort of talk about some of the experiences with

26
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.900
Vincent Terrone: Yeah, that'd be really I think I

27
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.250
John Mertic: would really appreciate it. Yeah.

28
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:32.340
Vincent Terrone: Yeah, well, I use the group. I mean like whenever I had a problem. I went on to the open mainframe cobalt and I talked to Newton. What's his name.

29
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:46.650
Vincent Terrone: Paul was great. So would you like our, our, our final projects, the system went down in in during mid day they did.

30
00:14:47.340 --> 00:15:06.900
Vincent Terrone: Not like typing. So I will you send me back up. He's like, yep. So they had an issue where with some of the ideas. But other than that, I mean everything worked really well. Again, your laps are phenomenal. It just, you didn't have slides. So it kind of made it harder to to check over the Internet.

31
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:18.960
Vincent Terrone: But yeah, IBM was very nice they donated their slides me they teach they teach a class on YouTube. I don't know if you know that

32
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:21.930
Vincent Terrone: Jonathan

33
00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.120
Vincent Terrone: That's what's

34
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:25.560
Vincent Terrone: Long

35
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.320
Len Santalucia: As the Washington System Center.

36
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.090
Len Santalucia: Yes, yes. JOHN

37
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.820
Len Santalucia: Jon Fitch.

38
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:43.140
Vincent Terrone: Yeah. Yes. Yeah. He gave me his slides that he teaches on YouTube of Cobo

39
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:54.900
Vincent Terrone: They have like a 24 hour lesson YouTube thing, but I must have taken about 12 lessons of theirs and all your labs and together. I made out a class. So let's go

40
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.000
John Mertic: That's awesome.

41
00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:58.260
Vincent Terrone: Yeah.

42
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:09.810
John Mertic: Yeah, yeah. I mean, if you ever want to do some sort of a guest blog posts in the open need freedom project blog about the use of that we'd be we'd be delighted. I think that would be a great it'd be really great.

43
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:21.300
Vincent Terrone: Yeah, back BCC where I was teaching Bergen community college they offered everyone in that class, they were going to pay for admission to the open mainframe project.

44
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.280
John Mertic: Oh, awesome.

45
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.320
Vincent Terrone: Yeah, awesome.

46
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.660
Vincent Terrone: I didn't got someone that was doing biology.

47
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.940
Vincent Terrone: She wasn't even a programmer and she took the class.

48
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:44.790
John Mertic: I was kind of cool. I mean, I mean it's I think it's good for a lot of folks just have some cross discipline experience with languages like that like we see

49
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:55.800
John Mertic: Yeah, we see we see a ton of just an other technology areas will see, you know, biologists and you know different you know people in sciences that are really getting into like R and Python.

50
00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:02.100
John Mertic: For a lot of their work, so it's it's it's not uncommon. And it's actually really cool that you're starting to see some of that.

51
00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:19.020
Vincent Terrone: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I also mixed in. Now the mainframe and it to like I gave you know some weeks I gave presentations on what the harder I look side with the software with zero SS and C. Me and Linux running on. I did like little things mixed in there also.

52
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:23.610
Vincent Terrone: Let me get some material together to teach them.

53
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:32.190
Vincent Terrone: How to there was a good class. I mean, again, it was a free class that they give to advanced students and I thought was pretty cool.

54
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:33.930
Vincent Terrone: It is amazing.

55
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:42.810
John Mertic: It is amazing. We're cool. Um, I think we're starting to get a little bit of a quorum here. I know I'm

56
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:57.810
John Mertic: You sent her regrets. Um, I think she added something in the post. You know, one of the issues I saw, excuse me, I saw. Um, I don't know if I see Phil telly on the phone.

57
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:15.480
John Mertic: I don't see Greg McKinnon, I don't know if anybody from who's from Broadcom knows if he's available currently or not, or if there's any other broad converse on the phone. I didn't see any names that stand out to me.

58
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:22.650
John Mertic: Um, and I do not see James caffery oh I just see, feel, popping in right now.

59
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:37.200
John Mertic: So we right at the edge of core up here. It looks like I'm

60
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.210
John Mertic: Yeah, we have for

61
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:46.530
John Mertic: For the, for the seats here. I don't think we have any voting matters day. So it's not a big deal.

62
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.090
John Mertic: But actually may potentially have one here.

63
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.430
John Mertic: Hey Phil. How's it going,

64
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.220
John Mertic: You feel you're working, you're

65
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.830
John Mertic: So way Phil's working at

66
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.570
John Mertic: Our audio. Oh, hey there you are.

67
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:09.600
phil tully: Double Double mute. Sorry.

68
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.150
John Mertic: Hey, that keeps you extra safe.

69
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:16.170
John Mertic: Um,

70
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:27.090
John Mertic: So let's get started. I'm just wondering. Today, if we have anybody who would want to step forward and take notes for today.

71
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.690
John Mertic: Here, anybody

72
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:46.740
John Mertic: Raising a hand here, it's nothing very complicated just sort of capturing some of the action items and things of that nature.

73
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.900
John Mertic: Nobody you've done in the last couple weeks. I don't want to push her last few meetings. I don't want to push on you.

74
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.140
John Mertic: Know if there's anyone else that hasn't done it. That would be willing to step up and

75
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.220
Give it a try.

76
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.900
Michael MacIsaac: Like a Thank you Mike.

77
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.150
John Mertic: Yeah, it does nothing has to be complicated. This

78
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:17.820
John Mertic: Isn't a warm piece just kind of capturing the points and things like that.

79
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.190
Michael MacIsaac: Okay, you can shoot it. Yeah, do you shoot them over.

80
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.050
John Mertic: Email or add them to the

81
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:32.010
John Mertic: GitHub issue afterwards that might be actually the easiest. I'll put the GitHub issue up on here, which has today's agenda.

82
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.260
John Mertic: And also post the agenda here in the chat for everyone.

83
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.660
Michael MacIsaac: So we got four items on the

84
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:49.680
John Mertic: Agenda here. I'm talking about the adding plugins, which I believe we have the new maintain for the adding plugins on the call here, which was really exciting welcome Welter

85
00:20:51.540 --> 00:21:04.890
John Mertic: We also we're going to revisit the terse decompress incubation renewal and see if there's been any movement there and we still have the get have actions for hosted projects. And I think we have a few folks that are in flight with that that

86
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:13.110
John Mertic: We can get updates and then we'll just go around the room for all the remainder of the hosted projects and see what that looks like.

87
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:22.260
John Mertic: I guess I Charlie pause, Phil, I don't know if you want to kind of take control and run the run the meeting here for today and I can sit in the background or would you prefer.

88
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:27.270
phil tully: I would prefer you me nuts in the back. I'd rather sit in the background. Today it's been one of those

89
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.300
phil tully: Run, run, run days.

90
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.870
John Mertic: I

91
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.360
John Mertic: No worries. No worries. I want to make sure the offer is

92
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:34.350
Your the chairperson.

93
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.830
John Mertic: No worries.

94
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.030
John Mertic: Um, so let's go ahead and jump into the first item.

95
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:47.640
John Mertic: Up on the list here for day. Maybe I'll just share my screen.

96
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.970
Michael MacIsaac: So everyone can see the

97
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.020
Michael MacIsaac: agenda that we're speaking to

98
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.820
John Mertic: First item and today's the Adam plugins, which is up for

99
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:14.550
John Mertic: Graduation or renewal. We are excited to have on the phone here, Walter church who has stepped forward to take over that project.

100
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:18.570
John Mertic: I'm Walter. I don't know if you want to maybe say a few words here.

101
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:30.180
Walter Church: Hello everybody, my name bolted church. I guess I'm excited to, kind of, you know, join the during the project and take over for the atom editor.

102
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.110
phil tully: Welcome

103
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:54.240
John Mertic: Definitely. Welcome. Welcome, and thank you very much for stepping forward. I know you're sort of new to it. I don't know if there's any short term or mid term plans you you have is you're looking at this project, or if you're still just kind of knee deep in figuring everything out.

104
00:22:54.570 --> 00:23:16.290
Walter Church: Yeah, so I actually wrote the original project work that john are way used to put into this project. So I guess I'm technically like the original creator, I suppose. So I'm still getting familiar with the new model that john was using for the editor and then the

105
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.860
Walter Church: The steps for publishing updates as the next step. I think I'm looking into

106
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:29.670
John Mertic: Awesome. Awesome. Well, thank you for stepping forward. Um,

107
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:36.330
John Mertic: What the sort of the, one of the drivers for this was the incubation renewal for the project.

108
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:44.070
John Mertic: And I know one of the things that I've heard from the attack was that was sort of one of the big concern areas is whether

109
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.210
John Mertic: They're there would be somebody maintaining it going forward.

110
00:23:49.020 --> 00:24:07.620
John Mertic: I look at the attendees today and I do not think we have enough of a quorum to do the incubation renewal, but I guess I would look towards attack members in attendance, if we if you wanted to pursue a vote to approve the renewal via email or GitHub issue. Where is everyone sit with that.

111
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.660
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I second that. I think that's a good idea.

112
00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:14.430
phil tully: Okay, that's fine.

113
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.090
Okay.

114
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.030
Michael MacIsaac: All right, well, I will

115
00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:23.070
John Mertic: Get that going via email in the background. And again welcome Walter and thank you.

116
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:26.250
Michael MacIsaac: Yes, thank you all. Awesome.

117
00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:43.050
John Mertic: Next up on the list here is the term decompress incubation renewal um I think Peter, I know you had been engaged trying to you know get word of what's going on there. I know Ingo you had been engaged in the past. I'm trying to see if

118
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.640
John Mertic: either of you have any updates.

119
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:56.160
Ingo Adlung: Well I hey, this isn't go so I personally couldn't get any response so i i send some nagging males friendly nachos and not so frankly, but couldn't get a response. So

120
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.850
Ingo Adlung: Sorry, my hands in the air.

121
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.270
John Mertic: We appreciate it and go, and Peter, I don't know. I didn't see any I saw your email, but I didn't see any response. I don't know if you got anything

122
00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.700
John Mertic: But Peter you're on mute. I don't know.

123
00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.200
Michael MacIsaac: The old double mute.

124
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.320
Peter Fandel: Trick no no responses.

125
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.590
Peter Fandel: So DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS IS GOING ANYWHERE. Okay.

126
00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.300
Peter Fandel: Um,

127
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:35.280
John Mertic: I do know I did see a message in Slack. Somebody had some issues with it.

128
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.610
Peter Fandel: Yeah, the other side we need right

129
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:44.100
Peter Fandel: Yeah, yeah, there were there were, there was somebody that did post an issue. So that's

130
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:45.330
John Mertic: It.

131
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:56.190
Peter Fandel: There's nothing to say that something that is emeritus can't be revived when when the right people come forward. Right. Exactly. Yeah. If somebody wants to come forward.

132
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.100
John Mertic: At some point and revive it that's that's totally acceptable.

133
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:10.230
John Mertic: So I guess for the tech members in attendance and Phil, what are your, what are your thoughts here if moving forward.

134
00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.230
Peter Fandel: It goes Emeritus, right, I mean, no one there.

135
00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:20.820
Peter Fandel: Is no if there's no one

136
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.310
phil tully: There's no one touching it. No one.

137
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:32.040
phil tully: Did you know it's got to it. We can't just it's active. It's really not. Yeah, yeah.

138
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:33.180
John Mertic: No, it's very fair.

139
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.840
John Mertic: All right. Again, we don't have the quorum, but

140
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:44.340
Peter Fandel: We can conduct. This is about via email to get this approved to move to America stacks.

141
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.020
John Mertic: Cool. Any other questions or comments or discussion on that.

142
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:53.910
Okay.

143
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:56.490
Peter Fandel: Next,

144
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.500
John Mertic: Up on the list here is the GitHub.

145
00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.520
John Mertic: Actions for

146
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.410
John Mertic: Om P hosted projects.

147
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.130
Um,

148
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:07.140
John Mertic: From my understanding here. A lot of this is

149
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:15.630
John Mertic: In flight I know Mike, you're actively you're kind of actively working in the field long side of things. I don't know if you have any updates on how that's going

150
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:19.590
Mike Friesenegger: Yeah, well I just came back from vacation.

151
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.910
Mike Friesenegger: Yesterday, so

152
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:35.880
Mike Friesenegger: I was catching up on email and it looks like the the person, Don, Ma, it has been working with you on some GitHub security related things. And the last thing I saw was

153
00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:43.140
Mike Friesenegger: That you and he we're going to have a cold setup. I think either this morning, or yesterday morning.

154
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:57.300
Mike Friesenegger: To try and work through that. So that's the last I saw it. Basically, it's kind of working, but there were some security related keys that needed to be added into GitHub, to be able to allow get up actions to do its work.

155
00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.880
Len Santalucia: Do you have DID YOU HAVE THAT CALL with them.

156
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:04.230
John Mertic: Yeah, yeah. I had that I think we were running into a GitHub limitation were

157
00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:15.810
John Mertic: So good hands as the ability to store secrets encrypted as a part of the organizational or or repository settings you can store it in either level.

158
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:24.510
John Mertic: And I think the challenge we're running into is there's a limitation and GitHub, that if an action is kicked off.

159
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.080
John Mertic: From

160
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.940
John Mertic: a pull request coming from a

161
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:42.750
John Mertic: Fork. It doesn't let you leverage those secrets for some reason. So I think we had identified that as the issue and I think Don law was going to do some investigation into that. I don't know if any. I know you are also working on the Viacom, and I don't know if you've heard anything

162
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.310
From him on that front.

163
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.420
Vincent Terrone: No, I think he's good on our side. He can

164
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:53.880
Vincent Terrone: Come in, without, without any issue.

165
00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:06.750
Vincent Terrone: It's just a matter of now getting getting hub actions to use our jump box, but I don't think he's up to that point yet he's really just stuck in I guess they could have action part of it.

166
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.180
John Mertic: Yeah, that's my understanding as well.

167
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:19.710
Mike Friesenegger: So we'll keep discussing it during the day long project and will will will update on the next

168
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.060
Len Santalucia: Tech meeting.

169
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.410
Mike Friesenegger: How things are progressing.

170
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.050
Len Santalucia: From a long perspective. Awesome.

171
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:33.540
John Mertic: Awesome. And I think probably separately is also down that path to Vinnie. I don't know if they've where their progress is that

172
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.620
Vincent Terrone: Um, he's working. He's all set out. He doesn't have any issues.

173
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:55.860
Vincent Terrone: And I don't I don't I think he just said he gave us a status because we used to have a call today and he said that he's just been swamped with real work and that we're going to push you off till next week to get a status.

174
00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:57.750
Awesome.

175
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:12.510
John Mertic: Awesome. And I see a note on the the bug here that and you just tag just wanted to share. There's been worked on GitHub action Z support across different teams across the files cross compile support has been ported by the IBM

176
00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:18.600
John Mertic: Linux on the open source porting team initial work to build give actions with motto is done.

177
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:26.160
John Mertic: Yeah, I don't. I think it'd be kind of interesting to see how those efforts are coming together because it sounds like

178
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:31.680
John Mertic: Most of the connections at least might be together. I don't know.

179
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:40.020
John Mertic: I don't know, David. So David Ellison me to put you on the spot. I see you on the phone here. I don't know if you have any insight into those comments or Elizabeth

180
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.770
David Edelsohn: No, no specific info for me.

181
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:44.850
No.

182
00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:46.680
Okay.

183
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.380
John Mertic: Well, we'll take it at face value, then

184
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.280
John Mertic: Cool. Any other questions on

185
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:54.990
That topic.

186
00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:10.320
Mike Friesenegger: So that this is my present the the polycephalum project is using GitHub actions and it sounds like they may be having success. They may. Did I understand that incorrectly or

187
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.420
Mike Friesenegger: Vinnie or are you still waiting to get some feedback I

188
00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:27.720
Vincent Terrone: Know he we I was just saying we usually do a status meeting today and he was tied up, he asked us to move it. Got it.

189
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.170
Len Santalucia: Okay.

190
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.290
Mike Friesenegger: Yeah, it might be might be worthwhile if he

191
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:40.740
Mike Friesenegger: If the leader of the Polish awfully project is able to get something working maybe invite him to are failing called so so he can show it off. That's an idea.

192
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.110
Vincent Terrone: Yeah, that would be good. Okay.

193
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:43.530
John Mertic: And if you

194
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.890
John Mertic: Are. It sounds like you both are running into the same issues. We probably

195
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:54.270
John Mertic: could pull in Ponyo from the release engineering team he might have some ideas of how to work around

196
00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.470
Len Santalucia: Some of this as well.

197
00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.130
Vincent Terrone: Okay, that's good.

198
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:06.330
Len Santalucia: Hey john. Can you help us get people on your team at foundation

199
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.140
Len Santalucia: were asking about Jenkins way in the beginning.

200
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.430
Len Santalucia: Yeah.

201
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.970
Len Santalucia: Us. We like them to.

202
00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:31.320
Len Santalucia: Actually use it once it's set up final it's almost done with Jerry. So, if I remember correctly, there was a few guys that said Jenkins was important to have from that I

203
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.200
Len Santalucia: Remember,

204
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:45.690
John Mertic: Yeah, I think I remember some of the discussion there maybe it might make sense just kind of pull the parties together and have just a general checkpoint call on where the progress is. I think that's a good idea.

205
00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:57.240
John Mertic: Maybe, maybe as a follow up, I can you know suggest such a call and whoever from the projects that are in this we can participate, is that that kind of sound like where your head's at.

206
00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.490
Len Santalucia: Blend. Yeah, exactly. Okay.

207
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:14.550
Len Santalucia: You know, we're after all the work of setting it up. Now we want to get people actually using it and you know critiquing yet any kind of feedback. I don't care. Good better and different is important.

208
00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.960
Len Santalucia: As I'm sure it's the same stuff. So it should be any different.

209
00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.950
John Mertic: Definitely, and we want to also make sure we

210
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:32.430
John Mertic: Can start role if you know if this is a good pattern we can get this rolling out for all projects that they come on board. I know you know we have several projects that could potentially leverage this

211
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:33.600
Okay.

212
00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.330
John Mertic: Any other questions, comments, discussion on that.

213
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:50.970
John Mertic: Okay. Um, and so we have a fair amount of time this week to do a walk around.

214
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.540
John Mertic: And touch on where we're at with tech projects.

215
00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.110
So,

216
00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:07.410
John Mertic: Let's maybe start with our active and then we'll go to our incubating projects. And I don't think we have anybody from the project on the call.

217
00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:17.280
John Mertic: I do know that mentees and working on, there's been some additions happening to that code base, but I don't have anything else to report. I don't know if anybody else does.

218
00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:26.880
John Mertic: Okay um next mentorship, Bob, do you want to

219
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:28.020
John Mertic: Read the updates.

220
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:41.130
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): We got about a month and a half for the mentorship for this year to go. So in the next few weeks. I'm going to do a final presentation so that the mentors and mentees understand what they need to do for wrap up.

221
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:49.590
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Second step, and had gone out. We found that there's been some problems getting the money to

222
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.690
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You know some of the

223
00:34:54.420 --> 00:35:06.270
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): More remote students. I guess the banks aren't because a coven are kind of shut down and they're not transferring the money as quickly. So it's been two, three weeks for money to get transferred

224
00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:09.900
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I think

225
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:17.040
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): So, so things are going pretty well. One of the things that we've we've gotten some requests for

226
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:35.550
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Doing projects over the next fiscal academic year. We got Western University from Ontario. I think it's Ontario or in Toronto. They're looking for an a project. And what we'd like to do is we'd like to get a list of projects that people are interested in

227
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:41.760
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Our PROJECTS SOME OF THE OPEN mainframe projects are interested in getting some

228
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.700
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Kind of free labor here students

229
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:53.550
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): To help out during the year, but we need to identify that and actually Western University is looking for somebody in

230
00:35:54.120 --> 00:36:05.280
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): A project in short order. They've got a few students there. They think, I don't know if they could use more than one, but they certainly are pushing hard for a project. So if anyone's got a project that they could come up with

231
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:12.330
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): In short order here. We really appreciate it. Because it's important to get these universities active

232
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.890
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): And what we'd like to do is start collecting

233
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.490
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Projects so that we have a kind of

234
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:27.840
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): A list of potential projects in the future. So we don't have to kind of last minute kind of started looking for projects.

235
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:40.380
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): So this year is ending. We're going to be beginning next year projects. Pretty soon collecting them. So if anyone's got a project or idea of where we can get a project for Western please let me know.

236
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:51.060
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): So I'll be sending up a meeting with the mentors and mentees probably in the next few weeks of the semester starting so it's

237
00:36:51.810 --> 00:37:07.680
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Next week, so you know I'm kind of busy, but I love. One of the things that the mentees going to have to do is come up with a video presentation on their project. So I want to give them enough lead time so that they can know what to do because that's due at the end of September.

238
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.770
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): That's it for me unless someone's got a project they want to volunteer.

239
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.430
Alex Kim: Hey Bob Salix are you think you just

240
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:17.700
Len Santalucia: Have a

241
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:22.620
Alex Kim: Question. The end of the project presentation will

242
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:29.010
Alex Kim: Get be also part of the open mainframe product summit, so the agenda.

243
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.200
Alex Kim: We have a session for me.

244
00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:32.790
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Yeah, I'm

245
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:41.160
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I don't know if we're going to get them in time, you know, because I think they're due on the 31st and the summit open mainframe summit is

246
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:56.850
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): On the 16th, we can see if we actually, if I can get a meeting together quickly. There might be possibility that we could get some or all of them done by then I'll, I'll put that on my things to do.

247
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:59.940
John Mertic: And Bob. One other thing that we're

248
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:01.260
John Mertic: I think we have pretty much

249
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:13.860
John Mertic: secured his time at the open source summit Europe virtual event at the end of October. It's the one that the students had typically went to in the past when it was in person, but we've I think we've secured.

250
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:24.930
John Mertic: Time as a part of the open mainframe project mini Summit for them to present as well. So, you know, if you have some that are able to present early. Great. And then, if not, then we can catch them.

251
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.350
John Mertic: We can catch the full length of them at that

252
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:40.140
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Well be good to get them as much exposure as possible. And the idea of the video presentations is is that it's not a one time deal because what we're gonna do is we're going to post them up.

253
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:49.140
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Hopefully on our website so that the students have exposure for, you know, until the next group comes in. So

254
00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.180
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): I think

255
00:38:53.070 --> 00:39:03.600
Ingo Adlung: Hey, Bob. This is English, so I will reach out to my team song, can you can you can you just quickly and say again from win to win this would run

256
00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:07.530
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): The projects for the academic for like Western

257
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:26.160
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Yeah, yeah, it would. I'm not really sure. It's like, for instance, if it's a capstone like mine, it would run two semesters, but I'm not sure I'd have to read the email. Again, I'll get back to you and go to to let you know. But I it's either a semester to semester project. They're looking for

258
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:27.960
Ingo Adlung: Okay, great. Thank you.

259
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:33.390
John Mertic: And for any of our hosted projects. This is also a great opportunity.

260
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:34.770
Len Santalucia: To get folks.

261
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.980
John Mertic: To get new students and new competitors engaged so

262
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.790
John Mertic: Yeah, make maybe with FAIL ALONG or

263
00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.180
John Mertic: You know, Peter, maybe this might be something interesting for this project as well.

264
00:39:49.680 --> 00:40:09.570
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): What's a good way to recruit people into your project because we've had success with students getting on these projects and then staying with the open source after the fact. I think Linux alpine is one that was developed by a mentee. And he actually kept it going and now

265
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.280
An IBM employee.

266
00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:14.550
Ingo Adlung: Oh, what's this one.

267
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:15.660
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Yeah yeah

268
00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.680
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): You started out as a

269
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.510
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): Open mainframe Linux.

270
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.560
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): mint tea, that's how we started.

271
00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:27.690
Ingo Adlung: Oh, yeah.

272
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.310
Ingo Adlung: One is a smart guy.

273
00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:30.600
Ingo Adlung: We need more of those.

274
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.200
John Mertic: This wasn't the best way to find them.

275
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:37.440
Bob Dahlberg (VCU): This is what this program is all about mining resources.

276
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:38.340
Yeah.

277
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.890
John Mertic: Awesome. Any other questions on the mentorship program.

278
00:40:45.000 --> 00:41:00.480
Matt Hogstrom: Yeah, actually I had one john I maybe I'm not sure if this is the right time, but I'll try it. Hey, it was a question actually to Alex, I can't remember the name of the project that you were mentoring, but it had to do with getting RMS data.

279
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.440
Matt Hogstrom: Off of

280
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.480
Matt Hogstrom: The sea machine converting it to XML and then doing some graphing of it.

281
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:13.170
Matt Hogstrom: I went out and looked at the project and looks like it's been going for quite some time, but there were no commits to source code.

282
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.220
Matt Hogstrom: Oh, it's curious where they were actually doing the work. So

283
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:22.080
Alex Kim: Yeah. Hi, Matt, thank you. So we just temporarily name as a zebra.

284
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:24.450
Alex Kim: It's not official name.

285
00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:33.870
Alex Kim: And I'm using probably it for now because I'm you want to clean up the code. It was part of the mentorship program so

286
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:55.470
Alex Kim: There were like a you know a lot of code update course, he's a he's still a student is actually medical students in Nigeria, so he's learning to code. And I said, it's been very good. I think we are doing code review and commit to the BU MP mentorship program good soon on

287
00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:02.550
Alex Kim: A VISIT if you interested in. We can give you the GitHub access. So today, you can take a look

288
00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:11.970
Matt Hogstrom: If you could, that would be great. There are some questions caught up around internally about it and I just couldn't get a sense of what actually had been done or what it looked like so.

289
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:19.560
Alex Kim: For sure. I think give you the link and also he he he generated great documentation around it, too.

290
00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:23.700
Matt Hogstrom: Yeah, I saw the documentation was out there that was that was really great. And we

291
00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:28.830
Matt Hogstrom: Look at the source code and it was empty. So yeah, if you could provide access that would be excellent.

292
00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.890
Alex Kim: Sure, I'll send you an email right away. Thank you.

293
00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.690
Matt Hogstrom: All right, thank you. Alex here.

294
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:43.260
John Mertic: Awesome awesome and Matt a great place for that sort of question. So, so no worries there whatsoever.

295
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.430
John Mertic: Anything else on the mentorship program.

296
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.260
John Mertic: Alright, Zoe, um,

297
00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.880
John Mertic: Peter, I keep looking at you put on the spot. I don't know if you want to talk about this.

298
00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:09.240
Peter Fandel: And only that it continues to to get stronger and stronger and going great.

299
00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:18.210
John Mertic: Indeed it does. I think they just had another review the cadence released yesterday.

300
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.450
Peter Fandel: I believe the day before 114 is released yesterday.

301
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:23.340
Peter Fandel: Yep.

302
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:32.340
John Mertic: Cool, yeah. Things are rockin and rollin there. Any questions for anybody, or any other. Anybody else have any feedback on Zoe that they would want to share

303
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:50.280
John Mertic: All right, let's roll into incubation projects will go also in alphabetical order. Emma tues I think I see you, Joe out there. And yeah, the other Joe both Joe's

304
00:43:52.620 --> 00:44:07.560
Joe Bostian: Um, okay. So we're continuing to build out some content out there. We've actually spent a lot of time doing containerized workloads, but just in the last month or so I've created a new repo for iOS native

305
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:16.080
Joe Bostian: Applications and information to help people that want to do development on the platform so

306
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:27.840
Joe Bostian: There are two new container Docker file recipes out there now that that had been pushed that have been pushed up or merged in from a pull request and

307
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:46.980
Joe Bostian: we've iterated a few times to freshen up some of the other Docker file recipes that are out there and Linux container repo on the Z iOS native side. Um, I wanted to put some information. I put some information out there just explaining

308
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:56.400
Joe Bostian: Things you know to the new developer to the platform, things like, you know, we're an ASCII platform on Z OS. We're not an ASCII platform on the Linux side.

309
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:08.700
Joe Bostian: Both platforms, you know, share big Indian bite order and just give sort of all of that kind of introductory information to developers who maybe

310
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:20.820
Joe Bostian: Have a background, you know, as developers, but are new to the platform. So we're continuing to push that kind of content out there and trying to get that basic knowledge of built up over time.

311
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:28.950
John Mertic: Awesome awesome sounds a great progress and I'll note here for the next meeting.

312
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.350
John Mertic: Of the tack.

313
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:32.730
Len Santalucia: The attacking

314
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.600
John Mertic: Will be able to

315
00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:41.010
John Mertic: Consider the incubation renewal for the project as you're getting towards that one year mark here at the beginning of September. Okay.

316
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.710
John Mertic: Any questions or

317
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.120
John Mertic: Other comments in the group.

318
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:59.640
John Mertic: Awesome. Thank you. I'm Walter will skip past you for the Adam language since you already have chimed in, if that's okay.

319
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:04.710
Walter Church: Yeah, that's good thing. Awesome.

320
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.770
John Mertic: Uh, let's go to the cobalt Programming course. I don't know if we have anybody on the line.

321
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.200
Len Santalucia: With that project that could present

322
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.600
John Mertic: See anybody else. I don't see any hands coming up either

323
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.830
John Mertic: All right, we'll keep moving.

324
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.230
John Mertic: Education Project. I think I see a few folks from that team on the call.

325
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:50.550
Guilherme Cartier: Alright, so this is Cartier here. So yes, in the past few months, we've been working a lot internally trying to to come up with the go to market strategy for this project.

326
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.620
Guilherme Cartier: Since it and involves

327
00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:06.210
Guilherme Cartier: The collaboration between IBM and Broadcom there's still a lot of work that needs to be done internally on both IBM and Broadcom so we've been keeping some, some of those meetings privately.

328
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:08.910
Guilherme Cartier: But we do have

329
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:12.180
Guilherme Cartier: Today, a meeting just after this stack meeting.

330
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.090
Guilherme Cartier: We will be having every month.

331
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:29.550
Guilherme Cartier: At least one public meeting to the community to anyone who's interesting and getting more involved with this project and and chipping in and kind of understanding where we are at. Then, and where we can go

332
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:35.880
Guilherme Cartier: So every month, we will have a meeting just probably just after the tech meeting. So every

333
00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:48.630
Guilherme Cartier: Thursday I think on a demo where we have the tech meeting. So that's basically it for the project right now, we're still we're still basically working on on this. Go to Market Strategy.

334
00:47:52.890 --> 00:48:01.110
John Mertic: Awesome. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you so much here and I'm going to put the link to that meeting in the chat for everybody, if that's okay.

335
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:03.930
Guilherme Cartier: Yeah, absolutely.

336
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.860
John Mertic: Hopefully, have the right

337
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:07.110
John Mertic: Yeah hopefully that's the right WebEx. I just tried to pull it up.

338
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:11.760
Guilherme Cartier: Yeah, it is. Yeah, I need to figure out, zoom, but, but, no worries.

339
00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.320
John Mertic: No worries. No worries, will help get you going there.

340
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.400
John Mertic: Um, thank you for that update. Any questions from the group.

341
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:34.440
John Mertic: Awesome a fail on I know Mike you briefly talked about the infrastructure. I don't know if there's anything else you wanted to share

342
00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:48.210
Mike Friesenegger: Yeah, just to two other things very quickly. One is I think this week you presented to the on p governing board and I provided a current goal and a future goal.

343
00:48:49.230 --> 00:49:07.410
Mike Friesenegger: The current goal is absolutely working on that a CI CD and you know the taking advantage of the the hardware that might come infinity is donating for not only CI CD, but also environment for developers to contribute to fail long and then the future goal of of

344
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:10.170
Mike Friesenegger: Graduating from an incubator.

345
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.580
Len Santalucia: Project to

346
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:25.020
Mike Friesenegger: To a fully graduated and when project that's that's our future will after we get this done. So that's number one. And then the second one is only up some it's right around the corner. So we need to get our presentations prepped and delivered. I think by the end of next week.

347
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:31.800
Mike Friesenegger: Our recordings done. I'm sorry, the recordings of our sessions I should be more specific.

348
00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:45.060
John Mertic: Awesome. Yes, yes. And that's a thank you for the reminder plug their of the open mainframe summit, it is coming up quickly here, a little over a month away.

349
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:55.560
John Mertic: You know, definitely. If you haven't had this on your radar. Please make sure it is. We have just about all of our projects.

350
00:49:56.010 --> 00:50:12.840
John Mertic: Presenting in some capacity or another, which is really exciting. And we're going to have a number of announcements on some of the new projects and other items as well. And a lot of great talks Ross mores keynote and Greg go out coach and Zeppelin, amongst others, I put a link in the chat.

351
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.340
John Mertic: It should be a great event. It's a $50 registration.

352
00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:24.600
John Mertic: So we keep also try to keep the cross really low there to help everybody attend as much as possible so

353
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.200
Joe Devlin: Are you using the same AV company the chairs using

354
00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:29.550
John Mertic: We are not

355
00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.180
John Mertic: So that is a very good call.

356
00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:34.290
John Mertic: We are

357
00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.660
John Mertic: So we're actually using a platform called meeting play

358
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:38.070
John Mertic: Which we have actually

359
00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.050
John Mertic: I don't know.

360
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:57.210
John Mertic: If you all are aware when our back when coven 19 hit our entire event staff came off the road and spent probably about six weeks researching every single platform online platform available.

361
00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:06.900
John Mertic: And came with a lot of recommendations and actually even put those out on a blog post, we actually basically open sourced all of our findings.

362
00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:21.450
John Mertic: So the, the one that they'd recommend for the size of that we were looking at was meeting play. We've talked with a lot of we've used it already. For a few events and had some pretty good success. I believe Susa con was run on reading play and they were really happy with it.

363
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:32.400
John Mertic: So overall, we, we are not anticipating any of the issues, seeing there although that is definitely unfortunately what happened with Sharon.

364
00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:37.770
John Mertic: I think they're trying to work on what next steps looks likes for that.

365
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.560
John Mertic: So, so, yeah, we are using a different platform.

366
00:51:49.410 --> 00:52:03.360
John Mertic: Um, and actually make your other comment. They reminded me of just a touch point from the governing board is this makes shared the governing board meets quarterly and we try to share a nice update of where all the projects are there's often a ton of interest in governing board members.

367
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:12.990
John Mertic: I think I generally heard a lot of positive comments, although we are we are fortunate to have the chairperson on the phone of lead singer. He has lent. I don't know if there is

368
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:19.080
John Mertic: Any specific feedback that you would want to share that the governing board indicated around some of our hosted projects.

369
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:27.960
Len Santalucia: Everybody is very pleased with them the progress for the most part, has been

370
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:29.880
Len Santalucia: Very, very good.

371
00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.630
Len Santalucia: The volunteers that are behind them.

372
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:41.250
Len Santalucia: Are doing an excellent job in conducting the sessions every other week or weekly whenever they're conducted

373
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.840
Len Santalucia: And

374
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:48.480
Len Santalucia: For the most part, the feedback is all been just

375
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:52.350
Len Santalucia: Very, very good, fantastic feedback.

376
00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:55.140
All the way around the whole

377
00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.000
Len Santalucia: Open mainframe project in general. So

378
00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:12.990
Len Santalucia: And we did talk a little bit about these concerns that people were just brought up about the mainframe project summit coming up and the right platform and so on.

379
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:29.640
Len Santalucia: And we are fortunate to have a team, the marketing team behind it that did the work that they did and selecting it i'll tell you they did a very good job and we we will not have any problems.

380
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:32.760
Len Santalucia: There is a

381
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:45.840
Len Santalucia: work to do to improve our enrollments. But we believe that those enrollments kind of happen about two or so weeks before anyway.

382
00:53:46.800 --> 00:54:02.460
Len Santalucia: And with the fee being only $50 for anybody and $15 for academia, we shouldn't have a problem with that. And our sponsorships are rolling in. Very good, especially are very large ones.

383
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:18.600
Len Santalucia: Which is excellent. So we have a tiny gap right john that we want to try to close in. And so we could be completely neutral with any money out of our pockets for the summit. I mean, yeah, we're trying

384
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:18.930
John Mertic: To

385
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.190
Len Santalucia: Do the project did have to do

386
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:24.150
John Mertic: Some forward investment to cover some of the costs here.

387
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:37.110
Len Santalucia: That much, but it's still good. If we can get down, get that covered with more attendees signing up and maybe one or two more sponsors even small ones would be fine. So

388
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:59.820
Len Santalucia: anything anybody on the team here can help with that. It's a great venue. I'm telling you there there's there's going to be a lot of people looking at this a lot different ways. So it's great exposure from all walks of life, coming to attend this IBM and Broadcom and

389
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:11.010
Len Santalucia: Racket, and many of us here on the phone or are driving and reminding people about it. I think it's going to be very good. So let's get a few more sponsors.

390
00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:18.120
Len Santalucia: That we can so we get a little bit more money just to close that gap. So we keep our budget.

391
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:20.910
Len Santalucia: as solid as it is.

392
00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.410
Len Santalucia: We've. That's one thing about this group, we have a pretty nice.

393
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:28.080
Len Santalucia: Salad budget.

394
00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.180
Len Santalucia: Will always can improve

395
00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:37.620
Len Santalucia: So that's some of my comments john I'll give it back to you. Thank you, everybody. Awesome. Awesome. Thank you. And for

396
00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:45.510
John Mertic: A lot of that insight there. Yeah, so definitely go check that out the schedule we pushed out live about two weeks ago.

397
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:53.700
John Mertic: And yeah, just really, really great talks we were that group is fortunate the program committee who does all the votes for talks I don't get to do votes.

398
00:55:54.120 --> 00:56:00.360
John Mertic: You know folks like Glenn who are part of the program committee do and they had a hard task they had over 60 talks that they had to narrow down

399
00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:13.050
John Mertic: For I think the less than 30 slots. We had available. And they did a fantastic job. So definitely go check that out. And if you're part of an organization that hasn't considered sponsorship happy to discuss some of those options as well.

400
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:27.990
Len Santalucia: AND JOHN I sent a couple of suggestions for substituting for the one that had a sudden drop out. So you're looking for a response on those as possible. Yep.

401
00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:28.710
Len Santalucia: Yep will

402
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.930
John Mertic: I think that was where I think that was leading a little bit of that. So I'll ping her and make sure she's on that.

403
00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:35.280
Len Santalucia: Yes, please.

404
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:45.900
John Mertic: Alright, shifting back now to project updates. Sorry for the the break from our normal programming Geneva ers. I think we have kip on the line in the background.

405
00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.610
Kip Twitchell: I'm here. Can you hear me.

406
00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:48.690
Yes.

407
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:54.840
Kip Twitchell: So we had our first a TS see meeting on Tuesday night.

408
00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:08.340
Kip Twitchell: And have been driving hard. We have released our first small set of of service code and have started a prototype PLC work on

409
00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:17.790
Kip Twitchell: Will give a better sense of Geneva ERS, and it's integrate potential relationship and integration with spark as we kind of talked about on the tech meeting last month.

410
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:29.400
Kip Twitchell: As we introduced Jeannie VRS to you. We have two contributors that are non IBM people that are going to be added as competitors.

411
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:50.190
Kip Twitchell: Immediately we had to existing IBM product customers the IBM product is called safir that we have open sourced, and they're supportive of own P project and and they both joined our TASC meeting last week, so

412
00:57:51.840 --> 00:58:02.670
Kip Twitchell: The thing that we were looking for. And I mentioned to john the other day is where we're now have people ready to contribute to our documentation and our installation guide.

413
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:15.720
Kip Twitchell: For making the process a bit more simple we're in need of a shared environment to be able to to work outside of the existing development firewalls for

414
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:28.770
Kip Twitchell: For running Jeannie VRS so that's one of our first first step. So we've got overcome in and progressing our project, which is good. That's exactly that. That shows progress, it's a good problem to have.

415
00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:35.130
Kip Twitchell: So we're, we're glad to have that going, I don't know john. Should I add anything else here quite up to speed on what we're doing.

416
00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:51.300
John Mertic: Yeah, no, no. I think this is a really helpful update for the group. And yeah, they had a really great TASC meeting Tuesday night. I think there's close to 30 people on the call, if I'm not mistaken. Right. Yeah. So yeah, really, really nice group there. And yeah, they're definitely

417
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.100
Len Santalucia: Often running and

418
00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.170
John Mertic: You know, the next big step is getting some see

419
00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:56.130
Infrastructure

420
00:58:57.330 --> 00:59:05.910
John Mertic: Available for some of their CI CD and other development. So probably definitely want to get you plugged into some of the GitHub actions discussions as well.

421
00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:07.170
John Mertic: Right.

422
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:16.650
Kip Twitchell: We know what we need to do so glad to be on board. Thanks for everybody support the enthusiasms accelerated our work quite a bit. So I'm glad to join you.

John Mertic: We do not have a

427
00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:40.290
John Mertic: Poly separately represented today from what I can tell, so maybe we'll just skip past that one.

428
00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:44.010
John Mertic: I'm Elizabeth the software discovery tool.

Elizabeth Joseph: Hey, so we're getting off to a very slow start, but I'm getting ready to send over my proposal to the list of how we want to structure the code repositories probably gonna end up with two of them. But again, it's just taking this time I should get that email out soon, though.

431
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:12.300
Elizabeth Joseph: But thank you john for for getting all the rest of the project resources set up for us that's been a huge help. As I've been reaching out to people on I had been linking our proposal.

432
01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:19.350
Elizabeth Joseph: From back in like April. But now that I have a logo and a GitHub repo actually have something to point them to. So that's a huge help.

433
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.210
Elizabeth Joseph: That's it, really.
