# Notes


## Zorse

Gabriel Gordon-Hall presented a new project proposal for Zorse.  

The project description is:  Zorse aims to collect a dataset of production COBOL and associated mainframe languages which Large Language Models can be fine-tuned on.

Phil Tully motioned to accept Zorse into the Open Mainframe Project at the sandbox phase.  Sean Grady seconded, and all were in favor.

**RESOLVED** - That the Zorse project is hereby accepted into the Open Mainframe Project at the sandbox phase.



## Discuss Atlassian Cloud Migration

Kevin Sandi presented a proposal to migrate all Confluence libraries and wikis to the Atlassian Cloud.



## New calendar for LFX Meetings

John Mertic reported that the iCal feature is now live on PCC.  Mertic said he will create vanity URLs for each projectâ€™s calendar.  Mertic proposed that all groups move to the new LFX calendar, and if the group would like to keep their Groups.io calendar, it would become the responsibility of the project to maintain.



## Mainframe infrastructure coming online status

John Mertic reported that the project is still ongoing.  Mertic said the current roadblock is scheduling time with Marist College.



## z/VM Community Tools Annual Review

This has been rescheduled for a future TAC meeting.
