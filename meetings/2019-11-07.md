## Notes

Bob D shared that he is working on restructuing the mentorship program stipends to be oriented around milestone completions vs dates, which should allow mentees and mentors to more focus on project design. He also shared that he is working to get project ideas from members and hosted projects, with the idea of going live with the program before US Thanksgiving.

JP Linardon and Mark Ackert shared that Zowe is planning a 1.7 release in the next week, and that Matt Hogstrom is stepping down as a ZLC member and chairperson.

There were no other updates on projects.
