00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.830
Guilherme Cartier: Good afternoon.

2
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.760
John Mertic: Excuse me.

3
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.550
John Mertic: So this has been the inaugural run of having the TAC agendas built from GitHub issues.

4
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:35.190
John Mertic: This looks like it might have worked relative that physically worked well. I'm curious on the practical of how this comes together, but one step at a time.

5
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.510
John Mertic: Hey everyone, I'm just doing some roll call in the background here as people are coming in.

6
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.320
John Mertic: I'll read the agenda, it's up in the GitHub issues. I don't know if everyone saw it was sent via email. This is our first go round of trying

7
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.950
John Mertic: Trying to do the agenda via that so

8
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.850
John Mertic: We'll see how that goes. And if people like that or not.

9
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.470
Vincent Terrone: Hi this is Benny

10
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.270
John Mertic: Benny, how are you

11
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.080
Deborah Carbo: Are you

12
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.490
Vincent Terrone: Good.

13
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.280
Joe Bostian: Joseph

14
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.990
Hey,

15
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.660
Vincent Terrone: I'm getting a reverb.

16
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.020
Vincent Terrone: Know, it seemed, stop.

17
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.840
John Mertic: Okay, can you hear it for me or

18
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.840
John Mertic: Might have been somebody over there. My econ

19
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.060
Vincent Terrone: Yeah, it was myself and other people

20
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.900
Okay.

21
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.650
John Mertic: Just making sure it wasn't on my end.

22
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.490
Bob Dahlberg: Tiara with that shirt.

23
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.480
Guilherme Cartier: Debbie, you're on mute.

24
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.920
Deborah Carbo: Thank you for notifying me

25
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.150
Deborah Carbo: Half the time I talked

26
00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.350
Deborah Carbo: I wore this shirt, especially for the speeding.

27
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.760
John Mertic: Fantastic.

28
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.920
John Mertic: Way to come themed

29
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.170
John Mertic: I dropped in the the chat a link to the agenda.

30
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.770
John Mertic: I'm getting a little bit of that feedback. Now, as well.

31
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.790
John Mertic: Seems to be better.

32
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.790
John Mertic: More people popping in here. I'll give it a few moments.

33
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.820
Len Santalucia: Reporting for duty.

34
00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.180
John Mertic: Thank you, sir.

35
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.430
John Mertic: All right, I think.

36
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:03.900
John Mertic: I'm

37
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.250
John Mertic: I am well

38
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:14.250
John Mertic: I am well I'm hoping I'm hoping we're done with this nice weather snow rotation, we've had here in Ohio. These last

39
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.440
Peter Fandel: Couple weeks. Oh boy.

40
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.210
Len Santalucia: Yeah.

41
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.450
John Mertic: I think we're I think we're kind of past that. So that's good.

42
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:23.790
Len Santalucia: Enough is enough.

43
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.760
John Mertic: You ain't kidding.

44
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.590
John Mertic: You ain't kidding.

45
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.310
Len Santalucia: Hey gang, how are you out there. I see all your smiling faces.

46
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:57.240
John Mertic: Alright, I think we're settling down here and maybe get started I'm just going through upgrade mechanic. Okay, cool. It's just going through to make sure I have everyone accounted for that is here and

47
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:06.750
John Mertic: He actually a warm day. It looks like. That's good. All right.

48
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.900
John Mertic: I think Phil is out of office.

49
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:17.100
John Mertic: And Mike. I don't know if Mark post was planning. Join Today I create an acre.

50
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.380
Mike Friesenegger: He is working on trying to get

51
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.460
Mike Friesenegger: In oh

52
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.800
Mike Friesenegger: Um, he's having client issue. So I the same problem I had this morning I'll help them with getting

53
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:29.610
Mike Friesenegger: Getting connected

54
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:34.380
John Mertic: Okay, cool, cool. Thank you. Apologies for a little bit of

55
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.180
John Mertic: Fun Party.

56
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:42.960
John Mertic: Zoom clients. These days, and it also doesn't help. I think this might be the first meeting we require everyone to have a zoom login so

57
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.480
John Mertic: That might also be a part of what's going on there.

58
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:45.900
So,

59
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.150
All right.

60
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:04.860
John Mertic: Let's go ahead and get started. I think we're gonna have a quorum today, which is excellent. Um, I'm going to put back in the chat here the agenda for today. So

61
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:11.220
John Mertic: We tried something new here of using GitHub issues against the TAC repo.

62
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.810
John Mertic: To build out the agenda.

63
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.700
John Mertic: So the idea here is that if you end up having anything for the agenda if you just create an issue or if you have an issue there and you just tag it

64
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.050
John Mertic: meeting agenda.

65
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.420
John Mertic: There's a script using

66
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.390
John Mertic: GitHub actions that goes and builds the agenda.

67
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:28.260
John Mertic: The day before

68
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.260
John Mertic: With all of those things ready to go.

69
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.860
John Mertic: So I figured we'd give this a try.

70
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.620
John Mertic: This is something that the Node JS community lives and dies.

71
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.060
John Mertic: By they love this thing.

72
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:47.190
John Mertic: Mostly because they hate having to do operational work. So this is a great start for them. So I figured I'd try this for here and see how it goes.

73
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.300
John Mertic: Let me know if this is a good methodology for doing this or not.

74
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.330
Peter Fandel: And so forth.

75
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.010
John Mertic: So agenda today. There's actually quite a few items on the agenda.

76
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.960
John Mertic: You know, not only going through some of the project updates.

77
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.240
John Mertic: We have a new project proposal.

78
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.940
John Mertic: Which is here to be discussed.

79
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:16.230
John Mertic: There's an issue here around discussing the concept of attack establishing a cig working group programs.

80
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:27.390
John Mertic: We have items on here for the atoms plugin up for graduation. And I think there was a comment on that issue from john R, which may want to take a look at tears decompress

81
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.910
John Mertic: Which I don't know if we have any updates on that one.

82
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:37.260
John Mertic: Zeros up for incubation renew all and then I guess the last one is the gift of actions, which I guess I sort of talked about already.

83
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.670
John Mertic: Anything were missing from today's

84
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.610
John Mertic: agenda that anyone seeing

85
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.100
John Mertic: Okay, good.

86
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.940
John Mertic: Let's go ahead and dig into things, then I'm

87
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:07.860
John Mertic: On the project update side. I don't believe we have anybody from a D on the call.

88
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:14.250
John Mertic: Let's see. I'll go through my list here because we have so many these days. It's hard to keep track

89
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:29.400
John Mertic: Here, um, we have Amadeus. I think we have the Joe's on here from Amadeus. Any updates on that.

90
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:38.970
Joe Bostian: We, we met a couple times our steering committee in are looking at, including some additional

91
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.100
Joe Bostian: Examples on these happened to be based around container use but

92
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.670
Joe Bostian: I have gotten some people asking some questions about

93
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:51.180
Joe Bostian: Some natively ported stuff as well. But that's not quite ready to

94
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.470
Joe Bostian: Consider so

95
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.480
Joe Bostian: Just I'm

96
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.520
Joe Bostian: Adding content.

97
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.430
Joe Bostian: Adding content to the library of how tos and examples that were, you know, trying to support

98
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.460
John Mertic: Any questions from anybody on that.

99
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:21.330
John Mertic: Alright, um, I'll get well. Maybe we'll talk about the

100
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:22.920
John Mertic: Atom one real quick and

101
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.910
John Mertic: You know, since the Adam was up for discussion. So

102
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:33.030
John Mertic: I'll put a link in the chat here in case you don't see it, Issue one zero for

103
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:44.430
John Mertic: Basically, it looks like john had responded to the question there around sort of with the current status of the project.

104
00:13:44.940 --> 00:14:03.180
John Mertic: I think he had a little bit a question on the trademark pieces and I can, I can follow up with him. Um, I think he sounds like he's at a place where he's moved on from this project and he you know doesn't really as much as have the time, everything to dedicate day to day and indicated

105
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:12.510
John Mertic: If somebody wants to take it over. It's fine, or otherwise we're going to embarrass Mr emeritus status likely make sense. Um,

106
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:22.170
John Mertic: I don't know if anybody sees those comments and anybody has thoughts on this or anybody who has interest in taking this project over to that's also an option.

107
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:46.350
John Mertic: I'm hoping somebody talking on mute about this. I'm just joking. Um,

108
00:14:48.900 --> 00:15:01.800
John Mertic: I guess for voting members of the tack is since there's nobody really coming forward here is the interest of looking to do about to move this to America status is that with the tech voting members would be interested in doing.

109
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:08.100
John Mertic: Or do you all want to discuss it offline first and then

110
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.080
John Mertic: Come back and look at this next month.

111
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:20.340
Enyu Wang: Hey john. This is any showy sort of a broadcast a message to a wider team wider team, you know, in case someone is interested

112
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:35.280
John Mertic: I think that makes a ton of sense. Yeah, it makes a ton of sense he had just tried to see where everyone's heads at, um, yes. I mean, maybe I'll make a note out to john to see if he wouldn't mind just dropping a note on the email list.

113
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:46.290
John Mertic: That if he's looking for new maintainer. And if he doesn't see a new maintainer then he'll recommend it to move to America status is that is that sort of sound like what you were thinking in you.

114
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:48.690
Enyu Wang: Yes.

115
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.930
Bob Dahlberg: If it goes to America status can come back as an act you know later.

116
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.030
John Mertic: Yeah, I can always come back.

117
00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.310
John Mertic: It just, we just need to qualify

118
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.790
John Mertic: You know, with the criteria for the given stage it's looking to come into yeah

119
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:13.710
Bob Dahlberg: Because I can see that there's Rex and Assembler in there and you know I can proceed those coming you know as as we develop other projects like if we work on the Education Project

120
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.100
Bob Dahlberg: You know this, these could be important.

121
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.150
Bob Dahlberg: This can be some of these topics or packages in there could become important to us.

122
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.890
Enyu Wang: Okay, each project will have nine lives.

123
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:29.790
Yeah.

124
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:31.530
John Mertic: Well,

125
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.380
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah mainframe was here, you know, we know nothing dies.

126
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:48.720
John Mertic: Alright well. Very good. Thank you for that feedback I will comment on that issue for that to be the next step there.

127
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.850
John Mertic: A going forward on the list fail long

128
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.050
Mike Friesenegger: Okay. Hey everybody, this is my treason Egger

129
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:15.060
Mike Friesenegger: On since the last tech meeting. We've had a couple of great failing meetings are making a lot of great progress and getting the CIC D infrastructure up and running and we're working closely with the Linux Foundation team.

130
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.270
Mike Friesenegger: And and and i'm going to give a shout out to my come infinity.

131
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:32.940
Mike Friesenegger: Who has created three VM guests on one of their L pars and and and Vinny

132
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:33.750
Mike Friesenegger: Has done

133
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:55.410
Mike Friesenegger: An amazing job and and on today's call earlier this morning he were he's just about ready to open up access to the Ci, Ci CD team of a long to see if we can't get that connected up to GitHub actions and start doing some CI CD tests.

134
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:10.200
Mike Friesenegger: On in addition to the CIC D side of the house Vinny has been busy creating second level VM Z VM, seven. One second level for a long developers.

135
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:22.050
Mike Friesenegger: And so there are, there is a way for people that want to contribute to the fan long project to be able to request access to a second level VM. They'll have meant access to it.

136
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:35.250
Mike Friesenegger: And things like that they'll be able to 30 to 70 vias Zoe, there'll be able to SSH to the Linux instance that runs Python Z VM SDK. That's the, that's the project itself.

137
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:47.160
Mike Friesenegger: So that is about ready to be turned on for a couple of developers to connect up and see how the infrastructure works. So I'm so great progress on that and again

138
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:59.700
Mike Friesenegger: Thank you to Viacom infinity also thank you to velocity software for offering up some of their knowledge and expertise and products to help in in duplicating the second level VM environment.

139
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.210
Mike Friesenegger: One last thing next week.

140
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:15.270
Mike Friesenegger: I'll take the 30 minute call or the next call next week in two weeks. I'll take the 30 minute call and I'll demonstrate Python SDK in action.

141
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:29.250
Mike Friesenegger: On my LPR within Susa that I use for my testing purposes. So people that are part of a long that have maybe never seen this thing and action. They'll get to see a very simple demonstration of how

142
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:38.910
Mike Friesenegger: How Fei long and the Python Z VM SDK project helps in automating infrastructures service on the VM.

143
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.610
Mike Friesenegger: And that's it.

144
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.190
John Mertic: Cool. Thank you. Any questions for anyone.

145
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.350
Len Santalucia: Good job, Mike on your project. Thank you.

146
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:55.920
Len Santalucia: Thanks. Lynn.

147
00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:05.550
John Mertic: And exciting to see, you know, one project leveraging the other project here to we're already seeing some of those interconnections with using using Zoho for your provision or end

148
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.150
Mike Friesenegger: Absolutely. Thank you.

149
00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:20.610
John Mertic: Cool. I'm moving forward here. I don't think I don't think we have anybody from poly separately on the line.

150
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:32.670
John Mertic: So we can move forward. They're terrorists decompress. I don't think we have anybody from them in line and they're still the open issue on that one around the marital status.

151
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:42.300
John Mertic: And if we want to just sort of keep that as an open issue until we hear more from clauses that that sound good to the voting TASC the voting TAC members.

152
00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.820
Len Santalucia: Make sense. Okay.

153
00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:10.680
John Mertic: Um, I think, Karen is here and I will also note here in that this project is sort of had hit. It's one year mark so it's ready to look at sort of an incubation renewal as well but hearing you have to provide an update first

154
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.910
Hiren Shah: Yeah, so

155
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.630
Hiren Shah: Last two meetings. We have a few

156
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:18.960
Hiren Shah: Tech meeting on zero

157
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.570
Hiren Shah: Last meeting was kind of

158
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.750
Hiren Shah: Something went wrong on my calendar so

159
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:38.490
Hiren Shah: Some people they're joining it 11. So in actual meeting was at two. So we kind of resolve it at this point. So hopefully next meeting, we will have people joining in.

160
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.140
Hiren Shah: The current

161
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.420
Hiren Shah: challenges we have with this project is we are not getting enough participation right though we have

162
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.370
Hiren Shah: workflows from the USA map posted on this community.

163
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:59.760
Hiren Shah: We are trying to recruit additional customers vendors and we don't have

164
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:10.620
Hiren Shah: Yet additional participation in in in this community besides the initial participants like IBM and one of their customer

165
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.320
Peter Fandel: So that's what we are trying to do like to

166
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:13.950
Leverage

167
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:28.290
Hiren Shah: Additional bad like education's any conferences virtual now where we talk about zero SMS we're promoting zero. So that's what we're doing to promote it.

168
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.460
Hiren Shah: getting traction is a challenge right now.

169
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.640
Sean Grady: One of the things that I'm a bit curious about

170
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.140
Sean Grady: Is I've seen the Zorro repositories, but

171
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:50.460
Sean Grady: Is there a website that indexes them because it kind of seems like the next logical step that you

172
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.230
Sean Grady: Have them but you'd want to

173
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.120
Sean Grady: tag them in some way that people

174
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.260
Sean Grady: Search for the ones

175
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:55.920
They want

176
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.560
Hiren Shah: So I'm open mainframe.

177
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:13.830
Hiren Shah: Project to has a pointer bizarro we are looking for additional pointers, like I'm trying to still understand where you want to have that

178
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.460
Hiren Shah: Tagging or index.

179
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.500
Sean Grady: Well, I guess what I mean it's like

180
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:35.220
Sean Grady: MPM, for example, is a great package manager and repository. But part of the way that people find out about the things on and PM, is that

181
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:49.740
Sean Grady: They have a website that helps you enter in a search query and filter the list and find out what you want. So do we have a sort of tagging, and indexing system to categorize the workflows, because I saw that

182
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.260
Len Santalucia: on GitHub there in particular folders, which

183
00:23:52.260 --> 00:24:03.990
Sean Grady: Is a categorization, but I don't know if people need to find that repo before they can dig in. Or if there's some other website where they can just type in a search query.

184
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.010
Hiren Shah: That's a good comment.

185
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:18.900
Hiren Shah: So if, if we can posted the link to this workflows from our IBM community.

186
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:29.880
Hiren Shah: Would that be the place like we have zero SMS community and people who want to learn more about zero SMS, we go that and and we have a link dissolve. Oh, but not

187
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:40.560
Hiren Shah: The same way that individual workflows are categories of work frozen not tagged on our website. So there's something. Additionally, we can do

188
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:51.180
Hiren Shah: Just rather than having pointed to the Zoho community maybe better indexed listing in our website so they can find it easily.

189
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:59.190
John Mertic: Yeah, I think, I think if I'm kind of parsing what I think you're saying, Sean, and correct me if I'm wrong is almost sort of a way that you could

190
00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:09.270
John Mertic: Be able to even better look through the repository and understand, you know, hey, this is the job that solves this problem or this is a job in sort of this category or something like that.

191
00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:09.900
Peter Fandel: Just to make

192
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.090
John Mertic: The searching a bit more easier.

193
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:12.630
John Mertic: For people

194
00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:26.700
Sean Grady: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Because it's it's one thing to have useful workflows and it's another thing for people to be aware that they exist. And so I feel like a good front end might go a long way to getting more buy in.

195
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.950
John Mertic: Yeah, is there.

196
00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.840
John Mertic: Is there any sort of standard

197
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:43.530
John Mertic: Hearing like taxonomy or tagging that can be done on the XML documents themselves like in the comments. I don't know if there's any sort of the methodology built into the standard or not.

198
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.100
John Mertic: Worth that needs to be somewhere separate

199
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:48.870
Oh,

200
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:55.800
Hiren Shah: Even if it is in the XML file right we have a taxonomy of what product.

201
00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:03.720
Hiren Shah: Is basically providing that workflows, or what it does kind of description in the XML but

202
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:17.400
Hiren Shah: I'm not sure how you can get inside the XML to to expose the data, you may have to have good comments on on repository itself did that talks about that that highlights what this particular XML will do. Right.

203
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:27.990
John Mertic: Yeah i mean i think i think i've seen and maybe fraud. I don't know if maybe this. It sounds like you're in might be able to use some some help in this space here.

204
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:40.920
John Mertic: Of how to do that. Like I've, I think what I feel like what you're kind of suggesting here is, you know, could there you know either be like a one page that lists all of these that you can just search through the page and then link or even within the XML.

205
00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.100
John Mertic: Like somewhere up in like the comments are headers, there's

206
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:53.550
John Mertic: Like a standard taxonomy to help people be able to just search that way. So like title. When it does, maybe some tagging or something like that.

207
00:26:53.580 --> 00:27:00.750
Sean Grady: Yeah, I mean that that's the, the problem is that I don't actually know what technologies that can accomplish this, but

208
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:11.790
Sean Grady: The thing that I'm visualizing and my mind is something more like when you go to search for something on Amazon, you check a lot of boxes to filter what you want and then that would

209
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.350
Sean Grady: Potentially help here too.

210
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:22.470
John Mertic: Yeah okay that sounds like maybe something to kind of take with here and offline or maybe into the next meeting and kind of chew through that's an opportunity

211
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:28.500
Hiren Shah: Right. Yeah, I can. I can work. I can send you know to Sean and see if he has any ideas like

212
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.160
Hiren Shah: Is it just index list.

213
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:54.330
Hiren Shah: And have links to individual repository item from that list, and that list can be published on our one stop hub for the USA map. And that way if somebody searching, they will be able to find that tax they somebody searching for provisioning kicks. For example, right, and then they will

214
00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:03.570
Hiren Shah: Be able to find a turnover website that would take them to the link into the repository where this actual workflow exist.

215
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:19.920
Sean Grady: Yeah, I mean, I'd be curious if if anyone on the call has experience in repositories or indexers in this way because there might be something off the shelf that can be used. But personally, I've not. It's just a user experience thing that occurred to me.

216
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.780
Hiren Shah: Okay, thank you.

217
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:32.370
John Mertic: Um, I actually, there's probably, probably could even have through there might even be something that's relatively GitHub, native to there might be able to use, but

218
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.420
John Mertic: Yeah, maybe that might be a good actually dig into offline.

219
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:44.850
Hiren Shah: Do we have is such a issue with either repository where they have some modules or

220
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.130
Hiren Shah: Are programs.

221
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:59.550
Hiren Shah: Those programs listed in the repository and how they they would like MPM is is one example I can dig into that and see how they are indexing into NPR modules, but

222
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.200
Hiren Shah: Any other example we have in a wimpy

223
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:19.470
John Mertic: And I don't think so, because I think this is sort of like a a different problem than some of the other projects have but I'll pause there and see if others if if that's something others would agree with or not.

224
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:33.330
Hiren Shah: Like when when we were talking about like atom. For example, in the head. Couple of utilities or racks.

225
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:41.670
Hiren Shah: How they are indexing into those, for example, right. I know we are we are promoting that project, but

226
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:52.650
Hiren Shah: Like similar project where they have some utilities modules that this particular repository provides and how one would index into it.

227
00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.120
Yeah.

228
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.160
Okay.

229
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.150
John Mertic: Any other questions on this project.

230
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:10.440
Hiren Shah: So what needs to be done i'm john to continue home for renewing for the year. What are the, what is the process that we have to follow.

231
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:26.850
John Mertic: So basically the tack just has to have a vote to indicate that it's willing to renew another year, and I believe we have a quorum of tack members. So I don't know if that's something of interest for the tech to pursue today or if they wanted to take it offline.

232
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.810
Len Santalucia: John yes lead

233
00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.760
Len Santalucia: I had a comment to make to the group.

234
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.130
Len Santalucia: For consideration on here. It's project here Zahra

235
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:45.630
Len Santalucia: Here and I have been

236
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:53.220
Len Santalucia: Thinking about this to my cell for a while now and I was wondering what you would think about this.

237
00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:04.650
Len Santalucia: You know what you mentioned when you're first spoke here about how getting interest is been a challenge, right.

238
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:28.290
Len Santalucia: So what I was trying to do is not the technical part of it. We're just trying to figure out what the people side of this issue might be and I got thinking that maybe what we could do, and this is just an idea for you and everybody else. What if we

239
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.420
Len Santalucia: Helped

240
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:55.740
Len Santalucia: The project by bringing it under the wing of one of the other projects that are closely related to this project to help give it a boost and more exposure and then reestablish it back as a separate project with it made sense when there seemed to be a good enough following

241
00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.020
Len Santalucia: Would maybe, you know, the one that made sense to me to try to do that with

242
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.420
Len Santalucia: Because it's somewhat related is the Zoe project.

243
00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:17.940
Len Santalucia: And, you know, it has the API's and it has the geo SMS and related in that type of thing.

244
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:19.890
Len Santalucia: And

245
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.910
Len Santalucia: After it was kind of taken under that wing

246
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:32.640
Len Santalucia: Then maybe it might blossom later and move it into a separate

247
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:48.990
Len Santalucia: Back into a separate project went to head more lakes, what does everybody think about that you to hire night. This is your baby, you know, trying to see how maybe an ideas might like this, like this might help.

248
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.900
Len Santalucia: And I'll be quiet for comments.

249
00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:00.720
Len Santalucia: Anybody have comments.

250
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.590
Hiren Shah: I would think about it then home if

251
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.520
Hiren Shah: Putting it under Zoe would get

252
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.590
Hiren Shah: Further interest buying because

253
00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:32.460
Hiren Shah: Some of the stuff. Zoe is supporting right it's more from development activity perspective with it to meet smart targeted to application developer type of persona versus these workflows that we are talking about maybe more targeted for

254
00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.960
Peter Fandel: Know coming

255
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.180
Sean Grady: Um, so my

256
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.090
Peter Fandel: Question is, what would

257
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:52.350
Sean Grady: It being under so he's wing Intel because I have concerns that it could actually

258
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.260
Sean Grady: backfire. With regards to that. So he

259
00:33:55.710 --> 00:34:04.290
Sean Grady: has a history of being in the past. A Morpheus that we've been working to correct and that

260
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:16.290
Sean Grady: It might get more or less lost in Zoe because it had been trouble to explain what so he was in the past, it seems like we might actually get better mileage by

261
00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:28.020
Sean Grady: Having them closely linked in terms of marketing, but for it to actually be part of this le project, it might actually get lost with him. So he if you know what I mean.

262
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:35.370
Bob Dahlberg: Sean, I agree with that, you know, and we want to make sure that we don't become these only project instead of the open mainframe.

263
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.220
Exactly.

264
00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:39.960
Peter Fandel: It's

265
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:52.800
Peter Fandel: Just because Zoe has more a more active community is by itself, certainly not a reason to lose something into it. Yeah.

266
00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:56.760
Bob Dahlberg: There's no question that's always going to enable a lot of a lot of projects here.

267
00:34:57.390 --> 00:35:04.980
Bob Dahlberg: So I think a lot of projects are going to be tied to it, but for Zoe to eat him up. I think it like you say it loses focus

268
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.560
Sujay Solomon: I would do, I mean,

269
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:24.030
Len Santalucia: Would you pick another project, other than Zoe. It's not necessary. I just picked Zoe. I'm more are more interested in helping zero continue and putting it underneath. Somebody wing so it gets some

270
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:29.070
Len Santalucia: Momentum somehow, some way because seems like

271
00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.570
Len Santalucia: It's challenged. I mean,

272
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.320
Sean Grady: This, this

273
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:37.110
Matt Hogstrom: Instead of similarity

274
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:49.710
Matt Hogstrom: Instead of quitting it with another project land, I would suggest that zeros overall purpose and mission is around automation and provisioning

275
00:35:50.490 --> 00:36:09.630
Matt Hogstrom: So perhaps rather than moving it with another group perhaps coupling some additional technology besides us. And if there's already been some work done to start add answerable automation in and couple that and blend that in the zeal SMS, which I think would make it

276
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:22.560
Matt Hogstrom: A far more enticing project than just workflows, because then it's focusing on its core mission, which is automation, not a technology.

277
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:30.870
Sujay Solomon: And I play automation right so systems ad automation being sort of the, the, the high level scope of that project.

278
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.510
Sujay Solomon: And the technology that would be encompassed

279
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.800
Sujay Solomon: With that being the goal could be expanded beyond the iOS enough workflows.

280
00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:50.310
Matt Hogstrom: Right, then it could be include things like Python and racks and answerable and CEOs and math. And then all of a sudden you have a blend of tools that enable a tremendous amount

281
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:57.990
Matt Hogstrom: Of provisioning and automation and you draw from a much broader pool of interested people that would want to participate.

282
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.360
Bob Dahlberg: I really like that concept.

283
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:01.140
Bob Dahlberg: I think

284
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:17.370
Bob Dahlberg: That the mainframe is EOS but it's it's type technology which is more enterprise oriented. So we've got two definitions there. I think of mainframe, but I like where you're going with that man it was

285
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:21.330
Len Santalucia: I think that's a very good idea. Matt suggested

286
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:28.050
Len Santalucia: It's actually a lot better when I said I really think that's very good idea.

287
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.880
Len Santalucia: How would we, how would we do that. So another

288
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.280
Sean Grady: Another point that I'd like to make here is

289
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.750
Sean Grady: Is part of the reason why

290
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:55.110
Sean Grady: Why there's challenges here just a matter of awareness in terms of, like, okay, so we have a lot of different parties invested in Zoe and

291
00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:10.560
Sean Grady: Rather than putting it in Zoe, per se, to the people who are working on. So we know what sorrow is I think actually having more of the community, the people who don't attend this call.

292
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:20.910
Sean Grady: Be made aware of what the other projects in the LM P do is is probably the way to get more resources here.

293
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:22.320
Hiren Shah: Yeah, well,

294
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.720
Len Santalucia: John you did that right

295
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:26.160
Len Santalucia: Um,

296
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:36.990
John Mertic: So we've actually started down this path, a little bit. So there was that webinar a few weeks ago and I think what that's actually one of the biggest pieces of feedback both me and I and others heard from that was, it was

297
00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:41.490
John Mertic: Really good for people who are sort of siloed in their own project to see what

298
00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:43.530
John Mertic: Else is going on. And I think there is some immediate

299
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:49.200
John Mertic: Things that people saw us cross cross pollination. I think Joe Winchester specifically raised that I think there was others as well.

300
00:38:49.740 --> 00:39:01.470
John Mertic: So I think there's some pieces along that way. But I like I I definitely think that probably more and more of that starts to get some of that cross pollination and

301
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:11.520
John Mertic: I think the other undertone, which I didn't hear this word said, but I feel probably some people are probably thinking this in the back of their heads is a bit of mentoring as well.

302
00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:26.610
John Mertic: You know, because I think some of you have been through the depths of how you build one of these projects. I mean, we've we we have LF experience on structure and pieces like this, you sort of understand more to the intricacies of the communities and and some of that might be useful to

303
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:33.540
Sujay Solomon: And and in terms of a desire to, you know, maybe use Zoe's outreach right now.

304
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:44.520
Sujay Solomon: A lot of Zoe does help with automation while so Zoe itself does not provide automation provides you the interfaces that can be used for automation. So if

305
00:39:45.330 --> 00:40:03.450
Sujay Solomon: If this project uses Zoe for implementing some automation sample then scripts and so on, that could be sort of the tie in and you'd be able to say that's our own leverage is Zoe, and they're, they're kind of connected in that way and and message together. Yeah.

306
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.840
Hiren Shah: Yeah, the one that when I say we have a challenges.

307
00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:24.240
Hiren Shah: For other contributor is mostly like because of this the way the main theme shops on the US, they have their automation it automation right but they want to publicize it. They have they're happy with the way they are doing things in their shop. They don't want to like

308
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.250
Hiren Shah: Make know how

309
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:27.840
Hiren Shah: How they have done things right.

310
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:35.790
Hiren Shah: So that's another challenge from at least from the system programming perspective, maybe, maybe things are changing on application side but

311
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.690
Hiren Shah: So, so we, I'm happy to

312
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:49.710
Hiren Shah: Get some ideas of how we could educate our SIS proxy team on a customer side you're comfortable doing more collaboration.

313
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:50.310
Matt Hogstrom: And I think

314
00:40:50.370 --> 00:41:00.270
Matt Hogstrom: From a messaging standpoint, I would, I would very clearly separate runtime automation, which is what you're alluding to. That's where you typically at things like system automation.

315
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.720
Matt Hogstrom: Option vs. You know, broad comes

316
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:05.460
Hiren Shah: Not including

317
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:15.540
Matt Hogstrom: But you're but you're more on the you want to enable developers to be able to have provisioning and automation in order to improve their velocity

318
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:24.060
Matt Hogstrom: And that I think is really the space that you're at. And that's largely Greenfield that doesn't really exist apart from old systems programmers.

319
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:35.400
Matt Hogstrom: Setting up and provisioning things for the developers. And so I i think it's a very different space where I think you would attract a very interesting crowd.

320
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:49.500
John Mertic: So, so this is great conversation. I don't mean to put a pin to this. I'm with it. Would it be okay that folks that are interested, I think hearing your next TASC meeting is a week from today.

321
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.450
John Mertic: Actually, I think, an hour after this meeting. So PM Eastern

322
00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:05.130
John Mertic: Would you all who's have interest in kind of helping him with that maybe transition side of the conversation over to their. Does that, does that makes I hate to put a pin to this. We have a lot of other things that I want to make sure people have time for it.

323
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.010
Hiren Shah: Would be that

324
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:15.450
John Mertic: Okay. And then in terms of the incubation renewal. Let's it does for the voting tech members, is it makes sense to consider that next.

325
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:15.900
Month.

326
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:21.030
Len Santalucia: Okay.

327
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:27.690
John Mertic: Alright, cool. Alright. Sorry to pin that conversation a bit. We have a

328
00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:30.780
Hiren Shah: Know, this was good. Thanks for everybody who is giving me

329
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:35.520
Hiren Shah: That ideas. So I will continue resume this discussion next week.

330
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.310
John Mertic: Absolutely. This is a great discussion. Thank you.

331
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:50.580
John Mertic: One. Let's touch on two more projects before we three here, Zoe, do we want to do a quick update on that.

332
00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.570
Sean Grady: Looks like both.

333
00:42:55.290 --> 00:43:07.680
Sean Grady: Myself and CJ are here so I can cover a little bit of what I've been doing first which is that we've been moving towards doing more of a joint

334
00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:28.470
Sean Grady: Program incremental development. And so in the recent one that was started some of our goals included access. So that is based on the mediation layer working in combination with CLS IMF and also

335
00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.030
Sean Grady: Key rings in Saf and

336
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:51.510
Sean Grady: There were some other things in the mix. But those two I highlight because we are nearly if not totally complete as I speak with those two. So I think the, I think that we're off to a good start with the program increment.

337
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.190
Sean Grady: Concept that we're doing. And so we and there's been a lot of

338
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:00.270
Sean Grady: talk lately about how to fire their align the different

339
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.660
Sean Grady: Groups, so that they can plan and work together.

340
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:13.350
John Mertic: Any other updates from others on the phone.

341
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:30.360
Sujay Solomon: And this one. One thing I'll add is we did add a new squad Zoe Explorer is a new squad in Zoe focused on a VS Code extension which is also starting to explore other technologies like Eclipse.

342
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.790
Sujay Solomon: Eclipse Taya and Shane and so on, but

343
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:43.530
Sujay Solomon: We've been trying to do that for for a little while because that that piece had grown beyond incubation within Zoe and had a lot of popularity, so

344
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:53.280
Sujay Solomon: We've finally got her gotten around establishing a separate squad for them and they will be on their way operating independently starting next week.

345
00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:56.010
John Mertic: Here.

346
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:01.020
John Mertic: Alright, any questions on Zoe.

347
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:12.600
John Mertic: All right. Um mentorship, Bob. I don't know if you have any quick updates there. And I know we're kind of getting close to the end. So I'm gonna make sure we save some time for the project proposal here.

348
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.330
John Mertic: Did you maybe walk away.

349
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.870
Bob Dahlberg: No, I'm sorry. I was talking on mute.

350
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:32.550
Bob Dahlberg: We've got the 11 projects underway. We've got one who submitted their project plan yesterday, which will enable them to release their first step and

351
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:47.640
Bob Dahlberg: I'm going to reach out to the rest of them. I've also been playing with a template for the GitHub, so we can organize and allow the mentees and mentors know what's expected of them.

352
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:55.860
Bob Dahlberg: So I'll be updating that in the next next week in hopefully put something on the books to meet with everybody to

353
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:57.120
Len Santalucia: Remind them that their

354
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.220
Bob Dahlberg: project plans are doing for the first step and

355
00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:10.710
John Mertic: Says, Well, thank you. Um, and I don't think we have anybody. Do we have anybody from the Cabal project on the line.

356
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.280
John Mertic: From a programming language or Programming course.

357
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:19.050
Len Santalucia: Well, Cameron was supposed to be here, but he didn't make it for so

358
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.850
John Mertic: Okay.

359
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:22.800
John Mertic: We'll skip past that one.

360
00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.080
John Mertic: Um, and I

361
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:31.890
Len Santalucia: Did you want to mention some of the work going on with that behind the scenes to the team here briefly.

362
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.100
John Mertic: Uh, yeah, for my understanding, there's been

363
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:42.660
John Mertic: The programming course itself has been a huge hit. I think there's somewhere in the neighborhood of

364
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:53.910
John Mertic: 1400 stars tons of forks lots of contributions and things going back. So I think that team has just really been trying to keep up with the fire hose coming at them.

365
00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.890
John Mertic: In addition, there's been some rumblings around

366
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.380
John Mertic: A project kind of

367
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:02.250
John Mertic: And this say

368
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:12.600
John Mertic: I think might be a little bit more focused on a working group or special interest group format versus a project around cobalt in general.

369
00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:20.460
John Mertic: And I think there's a little bit of definition working to come there, but I know camp ca is helping lead some of that.

370
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.100
Len Santalucia: And maybe there's some participation for micro focus and

371
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:32.460
John Mertic: Other organizations as well. So that's, that's something working in the background there. And I think there's an open issue there around the possibility of

372
00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:44.100
John Mertic: Starting working groups and special interest groups to sort of compliment the projects. So maybe we can kind of direct some more conversation around that as a concept over there, if that makes sense.

373
00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:48.630
Len Santalucia: Educate

374
00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:50.040
Bob Dahlberg: Project that one.

375
00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:51.600
Len Santalucia: What

376
00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.870
Bob Dahlberg: Is this, is this in reference to the educate

377
00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:56.250
Project

378
00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.370
Bob Dahlberg: That we've been talking about. There's been some

379
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:11.580
Bob Dahlberg: Communication back and forth about, you know, not only cobalt courses, but things in other technologies within the mainframe and CEOs and

380
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.190
John Mertic: That is, that's a separate project, which actually

381
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.630
John Mertic: They're going to propose.

382
00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:16.680
John Mertic: Today here if

383
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:24.060
John Mertic: Okay, we're going to try to try to blaze through this real quick. I apologize for running everyone so quickly. Here we have a lot to cover.

384
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:30.990
Len Santalucia: Um, let me just say a couple words and jam real quick about about for everybody say

385
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:52.290
Len Santalucia: Everybody else or ship hopefully knows that Cameron say is teaching cobalt at East Carolina University as he used to at North Carolina University for many years and one thing led to another would come, especially after all this press in and around co ball.

386
00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:58.440
Len Santalucia: Everybody saying the false things misleading things about it, as we all know.

387
00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:03.210
Len Santalucia: And then we started saying, you know, maybe this is a time to

388
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:11.580
Len Santalucia: Construct or create a project or as john is calling it right now work group in and around Cole ball.

389
00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.960
Len Santalucia: Here in the open mainframe project.

390
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:23.550
Len Santalucia: We had 1600 people post their

391
00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:36.450
Len Santalucia: Availability as coal ball programmers on our website here. And then along came others about PR one assembler and Rex.

392
00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:44.850
Len Santalucia: And we said, Okay, well Kobo kind of got this whole conversation started when some of those governors made erroneous comments.

393
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:59.580
Len Santalucia: And maybe we could call it heritage language, not not legacy but heritage Language Project or something along those lines. And that's how this conversation came about and

394
00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:01.560
Deborah Carbo: It could be

395
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:08.190
Len Santalucia: A pretty popular thing it's using those words happened recently in the trade press

396
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:11.070
Len Santalucia: And media.

397
00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:20.670
Len Santalucia: In and around this topic for us as well as open mainframe project, project. So that's, that's how it kind of

398
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:29.130
Len Santalucia: Was born and how we get to here we are today we're discussing this Cameron's willing to be actually the leader of it.

399
00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:40.710
Len Santalucia: Because he believes in it so much and you couldn't ask for a better cheerleader than him around this topic. I'll tell you that. He's just full of vim and vigor and so passionate about this.

400
00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:52.740
Len Santalucia: You don't want to get his way. So that's, that's how we got to this point of the conversation. Folks, this just want to make sure I mentioned it here today.

401
00:50:54.090 --> 00:51:00.030
Len Santalucia: To kind of start the conversation we can continue afterwards because I know we've got other stuff to cover. Yeah.

402
00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.180
Matt Hogstrom: I just gonna ask a quick question on that when

403
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.510
Matt Hogstrom: I was actually one of the

404
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.720
Matt Hogstrom: Probably many people that submitted my name to

405
00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:17.040
Matt Hogstrom: The state of New Jersey and six weeks later I got a thanks but we don't need any help.

406
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:20.280
Response, which is a little odd, but

407
00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:39.060
Matt Hogstrom: One of the things that I think there's, it's good to have this focus on coal ball and programming languages, but it seems to me that one of the areas that we're really missing any kind of real discipline on is the reality of systems management systems programming.

408
00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:54.360
Matt Hogstrom: You know, because, you know, for instance, maybe it wasn't even a cobalt program problem. It was more of a the system was choking because they weren't able to dispatch networking requests efficiently across the environment. So it's an

409
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:55.560
Matt Hogstrom: Overload Maggie, the

410
00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:03.840
Len Santalucia: Problem at the states was all their front end servers which were feeding into and connected into the mainframe, the mainframe was humming away.

411
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:05.520
Len Santalucia: Right, so

412
00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:06.780
Matt Hogstrom: So that was my point that

413
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:20.310
Matt Hogstrom: That there's a it's focusing on the languages, I think, is is good, but there's a whole systems administration systems management discipline that may be another candidate for

414
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.760
Deborah Carbo: Looking at in terms of education.

415
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:32.280
Matt Hogstrom: And I understand it was the front end servers outside of the mainframe, but we've kind of taken a knee jerk reaction. And now we're

416
00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.850
Matt Hogstrom: Focusing on languages. When the discipline that's

417
00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:37.590
Matt Hogstrom: Probably disappearing faster than

418
00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:38.430
Matt Hogstrom: Any of our

419
00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:39.630
Matt Hogstrom: systems programming.

420
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:40.710
Deborah Carbo: And management discipline.

421
00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:43.650
Meredith stowell: Hey Matt. It's Meredith. I also want to call out that

422
00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:53.910
Meredith stowell: The some of the things that we are doing around cobalt and you know through the mainframe project or not a result of

423
00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:58.110
Meredith stowell: What occurred here, but we're actually in the works for

424
00:52:58.110 --> 00:52:58.830
Meredith stowell: Quite some time.

425
00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:13.080
Matt Hogstrom: I still might my statement still stands, focusing on languages and systems administration is solving part of the problem. But ignoring a really huge gap was looming.

426
00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:14.580
Sujay Solomon: Well, there's a new

427
00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.960
Sujay Solomon: Project, because all the

428
00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:18.720
Len Santalucia: Languages kind of fall under systems programming anyway.

429
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:22.050
Meredith stowell: I think it's a great segue john into the

430
00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.820
John Mertic: Yes. Yes, and I

431
00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.990
Bob Dahlberg: Guess there's been a lot of conversation in the background going on this.

432
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:35.190
Bob Dahlberg: And I think, you know, and what Matt says is right on, and the group that's been participating has been hitting and just that subject.

433
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:49.320
John Mertic: Okay, so, so I this is i love the amount of conversation here. I feel horrible for the group here that is brought forward to proposal, I know we only have 812 minutes left. Deb, and you vet and all is that

434
00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:51.900
John Mertic: Sufficient or

435
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.490
Deborah Carbo: Well, it's dead. Can I even heard in my article

436
00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:04.860
Deborah Carbo: You are audible fabulous. So on behalf of me that night. We can segue into this. That would be awesome because

437
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.650
Deborah Carbo: You guys set us up to

438
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.330
Deborah Carbo: Thank you.

439
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:14.760
Len Santalucia: That needs to be made available to everyone.

440
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:25.050
Deborah Carbo: So I'm not able to share. I hope I table I ND I have a way that I can solve that problem for

441
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:25.470
You

442
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.230
John Mertic: Try now.

443
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.470
Deborah Carbo: Disabled unfortunately

444
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:38.280
John Mertic: Oh yeah. Did you as a co host normally that makes it work, you're under Deb.

445
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.870
John Mertic: Right.

446
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.570
John Mertic: Yeah. Oh, wait a minute. I see.

447
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:46.110
John Mertic: I see a second Deborah's that's probably what

448
00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:47.460
Len Santalucia: Here's

449
00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:49.230
John Mertic: The other permission.

450
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:56.280
Deborah Carbo: I see it now I'm looking to the PowerPoint. All right.

451
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.300
Deborah Carbo: I don't know what you are seeing her rights screen at the moment.

452
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:09.960
John Mertic: Looks like a piece of US letter paper.

453
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:18.330
Deborah Carbo: Wow. Let's see if I can run a slideshow or yeah

454
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:19.650
And it's not

455
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.850
John Mertic: It's not, I just still see the white screen for it, you know.

456
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:35.370
Ingo Adlung: You're, you're on a Mac, you have to four permissions you have to allow for for zoom to record your, your screen.

457
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:39.150
Deborah Carbo: Oh, that is the problem. Where do

458
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:41.940
Deborah Carbo: You want me to share mine.

459
00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:42.750
I've got them.

460
00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:46.950
Deborah Carbo: At the righty, that

461
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:48.750
Deborah Carbo: There's only one of me.

462
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:54.750
Yvette LaMar: That I gave you co Host Okay.

463
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.450
Yvette LaMar: I guess Debbie, Doc.

464
00:55:58.650 --> 00:55:59.130
Len Santalucia: Say,

465
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.230
Deborah Carbo: Okay, I'm doing it. I

466
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:01.770
Thought

467
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:03.570
Deborah Carbo: All right.

468
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.190
Yvette LaMar: We get on here. And, like, sure.

469
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.690
Yvette LaMar: And

470
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:15.090
Deborah Carbo: So while she's refreshing. I'll kind of set us up. So we're here to propose a project or community collaboration.

471
00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:24.630
Deborah Carbo: Essentially ease the very thing that was just mentioned access to me for an education for all job roles that are required in the marketplace.

472
00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:36.780
Deborah Carbo: And one of the things that we hear and see. And certainly, you know, I've been in the mainframe space for 25 years currently with Broadcom and

473
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:50.670
Deborah Carbo: In partnership with global technology services and the IBM Systems organization event and myself are presenting Broadcom with a few others what we're looking to do is to essentially

474
00:56:52.230 --> 00:57:00.720
Deborah Carbo: Invite the community to participate in an asset building environment or solution that can be shared.

475
00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:09.240
Deborah Carbo: And made available to anybody who wants to learn the mainframe. There are tons of great assets out there, they're spread across many places and

476
00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:26.640
Deborah Carbo: Things that we that and I and our team have heard over and over again. It is really hard to figure out how to kind of on board and raise maker. And so, whether it be you or people who are refreshing their skill. The new areas on the platform.

477
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:29.790
Deborah Carbo: So if you advance

478
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.480
Yvette LaMar: Monday.

479
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:36.210
Deborah Carbo: Through

480
00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:45.030
Deborah Carbo: Friday. So what we've outlined on the next. Well, the goal is that we have here is we've included, what are the

481
00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:57.900
Deborah Carbo: objectives and goals, who's currently talking about this in the background, right, in addition to all of you who are already talking about it in terms of Kobo and many other aspects of

482
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:11.520
Deborah Carbo: Enabling application development around the mainframe. And then, you know, what do we do with the idea. And is this an agreeable idea to this this room and looking for some feedback and advice.

483
00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:23.220
Deborah Carbo: So aligning best of breed foundational education.

484
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:26.130
Deborah Carbo: I know I have

485
00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:42.270
Deborah Carbo: Assets at Broadcom I'm willing to contribute that you have assets right from IBM. There are many, many others who leverage education assets have created education assets.

486
00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:50.010
Deborah Carbo: What we simply want to do is create an environment right where we have shared ownership and we can provide

487
00:58:50.760 --> 00:59:03.840
Deborah Carbo: Kind of a foundational learning roadmap for job role but support the mainframe so that business leaders managers hiring managers, they have access to that foundational material and it's vendor agnostic.

488
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:12.510
Deborah Carbo: Right, it's not IBM doing it is not Broadcom doing it. It's not the MC doing it it's it's a collaboration events.

489
00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:21.960
Deborah Carbo: That essentially get to a certain level right of capability and certainly wouldn't put any

490
00:59:23.010 --> 00:59:30.780
Deborah Carbo: Barriers on it, right, it can over time can become something quite incredible in one of the other things. So

491
00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:34.440
Yvette LaMar: Just wanted to mention, real quickly was, you know, by offering it through the open

492
00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:37.800
Yvette LaMar: mainframe project were able to get that that broad reach

493
00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:39.180
Len Santalucia: That that was talking about.

494
00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:45.450
Yvette LaMar: The scalability, because it's not just one company or us working in silos is being able to get all the contributions.

495
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:50.580
Yvette LaMar: And then it's also the quality and and and diversity of the material. I think in you put a

496
00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:55.530
Yvette LaMar: Great. She said that, you know, not everybody learns the same way. So if we can bring this material in from around the globe.

497
00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:58.080
Yvette LaMar: That has different ways of teaching a subject.

498
00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:00.210
Yvette LaMar: Will have far more better quality.

499
01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:05.310
Yvette LaMar: Take the next page.

500
01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:07.290
Yvette LaMar: Yes.

501
01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:20.340
Deborah Carbo: And so one of the things we thought about with regard to what is it, how does it relate to the opening credits project, what else is there duplication.

502
01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:36.180
Deborah Carbo: Is supportive of the work that's going on right though he is to enable skills in various ways right to have an open mainframe and encourage and motivate collaboration around

503
01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:43.920
Deborah Carbo: The coding application applications and the work that you're doing here, it's not actually code right it's it's

504
01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:52.680
Deborah Carbo: It's a different sort of projects more we're pulling together education assets, but we are creating something right and interconnectivity

505
01:00:53.460 --> 01:01:00.420
Deborah Carbo: That could be accessed by either companies or even faculty in university right and

506
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:21.450
Deborah Carbo: Bob when we spoke, you talked about how difficult it is to get faculty right so Cameron and Bob right they're all trying to get their peers in university to learn the mainframe and recognize its value. And we believe that we can essentially also create this access for potential curriculum.

507
01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:39.090
Deborah Carbo: Our focus is primarily on, you know, business leaders and companies that they can enable the future of the mainframe. Right. And I believe we're all we're all in likely agreements that education and enablement support this platform.

508
01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:40.680
Deborah Carbo: For decades to come.

509
01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:51.030
Deborah Carbo: Is the most critical thing. One of the most critical things that we need to focus on. So I'll pause there and see if there's any feedback considering time

510
01:01:58.350 --> 01:01:59.280
Deborah Carbo: Nobody likes it.

511
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:01.320
Yvette LaMar: Everybody likes it.

512
01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.030
John Mertic: Sure. Everyone is

513
01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:04.590
John Mertic: Here.

514
01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:12.930
Bob Dahlberg: You know, we've been at VCU. We've been talking to, like, Bank of America and capital one and dominion.

515
01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:15.720
Bob Dahlberg: And the Federal Reserve Federal Reserve and dominion.

516
01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.580
Bob Dahlberg: Have don't know what to do with their current

517
01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:37.980
Bob Dahlberg: mainframes and the feedback we're getting from these companies is is that they need. Students educated, not in particular areas, you know, kind of just Linux or Windows, but they want someone with a classical education. Now I got my education at NIU Northern Illinois University, which was

518
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:39.630
Deborah Carbo: All mainframe.

519
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:46.350
Bob Dahlberg: But they indicated that they needed students with mainframe education because it gives them a well rounded

520
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:58.260
Bob Dahlberg: idea what's going on. But they also don't have people in house who can strategically, think about what mainframes role in the enterprise is

521
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:03.960
Bob Dahlberg: And they're looking for universities to provide that. But the universities are woefully

522
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:08.460
Bob Dahlberg: Inadequate for doing that because there's not a lot of

523
01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:11.070
Bob Dahlberg: Professors in universities that

524
01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:12.120
Bob Dahlberg: That are able to do that.

525
01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.290
Bob Dahlberg: So I really needed

526
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:24.150
Matt Hogstrom: Yeah, I agree. I think I was going to ask a question, because I think the educational pieces is critical.

527
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:31.140
Matt Hogstrom: One looming problem. And since Meredith's on the call. Maybe she's got a suggestion here but

528
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:37.110
Matt Hogstrom: The experience that I've had with Zoe and other projects that are related to the mainframe.

529
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:44.670
Deborah Carbo: anybody that's interested can't get access to a system that they have sufficient authority on to be

530
01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.530
Matt Hogstrom: A systems programmer to

531
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:56.340
Matt Hogstrom: Explore, a lot of the deep bowels of the system to understand it to do IO deaths and things of that nature. So is this intended to be

532
01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:02.070
Matt Hogstrom: Just kind of a classical education, in theory, or is there an applied.

533
01:04:02.550 --> 01:04:03.810
Matt Hogstrom: Set of activities.

534
01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:06.330
Deborah Carbo: Where people could get access to systems and

535
01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:10.710
Matt Hogstrom: Really kind of tie that theoretical knowledge to an applied.

536
01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:20.670
Bob Dahlberg: solidification of that company has to have some applied application. Otherwise, because that's the way students learned today that you know we just did a survey of our curriculum.

537
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:31.080
Bob Dahlberg: At the end of this semester and the students go. They don't want to test they want they want projects. They want to be able to get hands on, because that reinforces what they learn and series.

538
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:33.630
Yvette LaMar: I agree.

539
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:42.150
Deborah Carbo: I agree with that assessment completely. I don't think we're there yet with this project proposal, I think it's a critical aspect of

540
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:53.490
Deborah Carbo: Training and truly embodying you know the capabilities were talking about learning roadmaps and paths that mentorship and the and the whole function of mentorship.

541
01:04:53.940 --> 01:05:06.510
Deborah Carbo: Have to also connect into some sort of lab types of services that wasn't even on our radar as far as a puzzle. I mean a bad, but what are your yeah I think we talked

542
01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:16.950
Yvette LaMar: A little bit about it. We were looking at system requirements and that checklist that we had and I think we had that read because we really needed to understand where are we going to need, first of all, where we were, where we going to put the content. And then also, do we need to have

543
01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:18.000
Yvette LaMar: That that

544
01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.240
Yvette LaMar: Place where they can have access to be a hands on experience.

545
01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:23.520
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah I know when I was working on that.

546
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:28.080
John Mertic: So I know we're right at the top of the hour here.

547
01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:45.330
John Mertic: We do have the tack here that is we have a quorum for vote now I do recognize. We're requesting this potentially right at the hour just attack one to proceed to vote would they like to conduct a vote over on the GitHub issue, what would be

548
01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.920
Deborah Carbo: Preferred from the tech voting members.

549
01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:53.250
John Mertic: Or do they want to punch it till next time and consider it, then that's also an option.

550
01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:05.160
Bob Dahlberg: Well, I think it's something that needs to be done. And as long as we've got cobalt in there. I think the coal ball would be a nice fit into this more overall reaching

551
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:07.410
Bob Dahlberg: Project

552
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:15.270
Bob Dahlberg: So I would propose that we vote on it today. And, you know, kind of, you know,

553
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:20.970
Bob Dahlberg: Get it out of the back room and put it up for a product here. All right.

554
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.590
John Mertic: Bob, I'll take that as emotion.

555
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:25.860
John Mertic: Do right here, they're voting member to second that

556
01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.830
Enyu Wang: Also good Amy.

557
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.450
John Mertic: Thank you. All in favor of the voting members, I

558
01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.380
I

559
01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.010
I

560
01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:43.470
John Mertic: Think that was everybody

561
01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:45.930
John Mertic: Any a poser abstain.

562
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:56.910
John Mertic: All right. Congratulations. You are no MP project I'm working toward helping work with you in the background on next steps.

563
01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:58.920
Yvette LaMar: Thank you all very much.

564
01:06:59.070 --> 01:06:59.700
Awesome.

565
01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.580
John Mertic: All right. Um,

566
01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:05.280
John Mertic: I apologize for blowing through this agenda like this is great.

567
01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:16.770
John Mertic: Conversation. Um, this is definitely something we'll probably have to work with somebody on figuring out how to make put less stuff in the meeting, but this is all good. Stay safe, everyone, and we'll talk next time.

568
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:18.450
Bob Dahlberg: Thanks, everyone.

569
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:19.230
Cheers
