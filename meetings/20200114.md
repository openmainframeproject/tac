## Action Items


## Notes



*   Project Proposal: cobol-check [#171](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/171)
    *   Dave Nicolette 
    *   Unit test for COBOL
    *   Current COBOL test tools cannot execute individual methods
    *   Other languages have ‘test driven development’
    *   Dave started ‘COBOL check’
    *   Dave gave a demo - ran executable cobol-check
        *   Allows code to be written with built-in test cases
    *   Suggestion was added it would be better as a plugin to Eclipse or Jenkins
        *   Eclipse would probably be the first choice
    *   Question - what about VS code, and other Web IDEs?
        *   Yes - could become a VS code extension
    *   Kip T: Why bring this to the OMP?
        *   This is mainframe oriented, OMP wants to be the hub
    *   Voting members discussed if this should be added as ‘incubator status’
    *   John M: Could there be a mentor-sponsor for the TAC?
    *   Bob D: How can the OMP help this project to be successful?
    *   Phil T: We make projects more visible
    *   Bob D: Should we have a marketing plan to make it more visible?
    *   Dave N: Agrees with most comments
    *   Enyu W: Ask project owner when a good checkpoint is - 3, 6, 12 months?
        *   Dave N: 3 months would be best
        *   John M: Would everyone agree? - for the most part yes
        *   Enyu W volunteered to be a mentor for this project
    *   Len S: Are you looking for volunteers?
        *   Dave N: yes, but is there access to mainframe resources?
        *   Bob D: We may be able to get students to help
    *   John M: asked for a vote 
        *   Mark P made a motion
        *   Bob D seconded
        *   Vote was unanimous
*   Project proposal: consolez [#169](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/169)
    *   Mike MacIsaac
    *   Open source tool to expose z/VM consoles and CP commands with a Web UI
    *    video describing the first prototype here: [https://youtu.be/vD_6PXeJWdE](https://youtu.be/vD_6PXeJWdE)
    *   Mike gave a demo
    *   If anyone wants to try, email [mike99mac@gmail.com](mailto:mike99mac@gmail.com) or call at 862-308-5089
    *   Jerry E: Our shop can use this
    *   Len S: I liked it when I saw it and asked Mike to bring it to the OMP. We can use this
    *   John M: Asked for a vote
        *   Bob D: Make a motion to accept as an incubator project
        *   Mark P: Seconded
        *   Vote was unanimous
        *   Phil will mentor
*   Consider OMP Ambassador applications [#150](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/150)
    *   John presented an OMP Ambassador selections document
    *   Mark P: concern Are these people asking to be ambassadors because they were asked to?
    *   Discussion ensued about different names
    *   Consensus - people who are active in projects, then they can become ambassadors
    *   John M proposed ten ambassadors
        *   Bob D made a motion
        *   Mark P seconded
        *   Vote was unanimous
*   Project updates
    *   No time
