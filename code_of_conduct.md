# Code of Conduct

* TOC
{:toc}

{{ site.foundation_name }} aims to foster a collaborative, inclusive, and safe environment for all participants. {{ site.foundation_name }} and each hosted project has established Codes of Conduct to help provide guidelines on appropriate conduct and how to report violations.

For all hosted projects, refer to the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file in each code repository that points to the policy in use.

For all other activities and events that are sanctioned by {{ site.foundation_name }}, refer to the [LF Events Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

## How to Report a Violation

Please send an email to [conduct@openmainframeproject.org](mailto:conduct@openmainframeproject.org).

## Violation Review Process

Upon receiving a violation claim, staff members will review violations confidentially.  The claim(s) will be investigated within three business days.  After the investigation, a private session with the Technical Advisory Council will be held to review the violation and to determine the appropriate course of action.

## Enforcement

### 1. Warning

#### Community Impact

A violation through a single incident, including the use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

#### Consequence

A private, written warning from the TAC, providing clarity around the nature of the violation, an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate, and a warning with consequences for continued behavior.

### 2. Temporary Ban

#### Community Impact

A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

#### Consequence

A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time, not to exceed 30 days. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with the TAC, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 3. Ban

#### Community Impact

Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

#### Consequence

A ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. Bans persist until a TAC majority approves a ban repeal. Banned parties must submit their ban appeals, waiting at least 365 days from the ban date or the previous appeal submission if rejected.

## Transparency Report

This report summarizes Code of Conduct incidents reported to or resolved by the TAC. Code of Conduct incidents occurring in the {{ site.foundation_name }} community reported to and resolved by the Linux Foundation Events team (LF Events), or project-level Code of Conduct responders are not addressed in this report. LF Events publishes its own separate transparency report, available [here](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/linux-foundation-events-code-of-conduct-transparency-report-2021-event-summary).

This report aims to provide a balance between transparency and protecting the privacy of victims and reporters to ensure a safe space for reporting. To ensure we are honoring our commitment to protect victims’ and reporters’ privacy, this transparency report does not provide personally identifying information about victims or reporters and provides only summary information rather than details of each incident.

All incidents resolved by the TAC have been handled in accordance with the Open Mainframe Project Code of Conduct policy and guidelines.

### Incidents Reported in 2025

#### Incident 2025-1

A report was received regarding a community member who made comments via email accusing a committee of racial bias, and in further email communications, made reference to challenging an individual to a "duel". The TAC met and reviewed the comments. The TAC made the decision to issue a warning to the community member based on the enforcement guidelines in the Open Mainframe Project Code of Conduct.
