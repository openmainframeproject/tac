Hiren said Zorow had it's first TSC meeting and is looking for more people to join the community. Hiren said there are numerous workflows contributed by the GTS team.

Bob D said that he has 10 projects for mentees to work on for the upcoming mentorship program this summer. Bob indicated that he would work to move the projects to GitHub and then we can announce the program.

JP said that Zowe 1.8 is planned for end of year, with work on the installer and virtual desktop.

There was a discussion on having a review of incubation projects for renewal - all agreed to do this at the next TAC meeting. There was also an ask to review ADE as it there hasn't been much activity on that project for some time. John M said he would reach out to the relevant TSC leads and ensure they are engaged.
