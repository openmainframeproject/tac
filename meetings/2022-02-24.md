## Action Items


## Notes

Mr. Mertic shared the update from Bill Bitner on z/VM Community Tools.

Mr. Mertic shared that the accepted Ambassadors have been contacted and the kickoff call is 3/1. TAC members are reaching out to non-selected Ambassadors.

Project updates:

- GenevaERS: Been working on port to Linux to complement the existing z/OS version. Paused on Spark integration, looking more at using MapReduce and Python instead. Looking at posting content on DockerHub.
- z/OS Open Enablement: Added new Slack channel #z-assembler-community 
- Mentorship - Share your mentorships now with Bob.
- Zowe - v2 Technical Preview posted. Been doing office hours in the past few weeks which has been helpful for extenders. New squad being created to split out ZSS from Zowe Desktop.
- Ambitus - minor updates to hosted projects, nothing major at the moment.
- Mainframe Open Education - starting to get content and loading into GitBooks; OpenSSF Best Practices badge done.
- Zorow - occasional PRs being added with new workflows from internal IBMers, looking for more from outside IBM.
- TSTerm - Seeing if there is interest from Zowe community in contributing to this project, with the goal at some point for Zowe to depend on this project instead of the existing terminal project.
