### Do I need to re-apply?

Yes, please apply before the announced deadline to be considered.

### Will you email me with a status update of my application?

No. We will only follow up if your application is accepted.

### What if I want to step down or don't have the time to commit anymore?

Ambassadors can request to be put in emeritus status if they like to step down from active engagement but still be invited to participate in calls and the community. If an ambassador decides to become more active again, emeritus ambassadors are always welcome to be reinstated as full Open Mainframe Ambassadors.
