# Open Mainframe Project Technical Advisory Council (TAC)

The role of the Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is to direct and coordinate the activities of the technical community. Its voting members are comprised of the Platinum members of the Open Mainframe Project, along with the leaders of each project designated as an [Active Stage](process/project_stages.md#active-stage) top-level project by the TAC.

# Projects and Working Groups

The Open Mainframe Project is a resource for open-source projects supporting or looking to support the mainframe and a home for open-source projects specifically targeting the mainframe. The TAC ensures that projects targeting the mainframe have the support they need to be successful, with flexibility on governance and licensing to ensure the community can operate and grow successfully. The processes and policies for the TAC to manage incoming projects and project stages to be hosted by the Open Mainframe Project and project guidelines are in the [process section](process).

In addition, the Open Mainframe Project TAC has established a working group program for the open-source on mainframe community to collaborate on topical areas pertinent to the community. More details on the working group program and how to establish a working group can be found [here.](process/working_groups.md)

Below are the project and working groups supported by the TAC, listed by the [project stage](process/project_stages.md).
