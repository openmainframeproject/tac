Marcel Mitran, IBM (MM) . JM opened the call at 12:01pm ET. Each member introduced themselves . JM, Senior Program Manager for the Linux Foundation, helping Scott Nicholas running day-to-day operations of the Open Mainframe Project . DH, responsible for BD and strategy for ecosystem on Linux on IBM System Z . MM, CTO for Linux everywhere strategy for Linux on IBM System Z . SF, CA’s mainframe CTO and architect . BG, runs mainframe for SUSE, also in charge of training . MF, SUSE technical architect for System Z, works with the IBM teams extensively . JM posed the question around a chair election, to follow up via email on a proposal. Rough plan was a 7 day nomination period, followed by a 7 day election period. Question came up around ADP not being a part of the TSC, and JM found out that ADP has not formally joined the Open Mainframe Project. SF advised that we should find out the timing of that before proceeding with a chair election. DH, BG, MF, and MM agreed. DH led the discussion on the goals and topics of the group. DH’s belief was that many don’t know what all can be done with Linux on System Z. DH’s said the group should focus on two questions, (1) How can this group proliferate the Linux on System Z message and (2) address the current misconception of mainframe only being suitable for legacy apps. SF said he sees an internship program as a way to get students engaged. DH said he sees SF’s point, his primary concern was business use-cases but agrees on students being a key. SF said they key thing was to make the work demonstrable. MM said he’d like to see people to internalize the value of Linux on System Z. MM sees many approaches to this, both finding and prioritizing ideas and methods for using Linux on System Z, as well as engaging the various software stack communities to ensure those apps can run using Linux on System Z. DH suggested the group brainstorm on ideas, and come up with a list of the top 10 ways mainframe can influence your life and work. MF spoke from his sales engineering background, and sees both community and business engagement as key to growth. MF proposed the group focus on three key audiences: Students (with Training), Business (direct customer engagement), and Community (projects to help apps run on Linux on System Z). DH and SF agreed. BG mentioned that often mainframes seem expensive compared to commodity hardware, but don’t realize you get much more in a mainframe for the cost ( you can have a whole datacenter of commodity hardware in a single mainframe ). BG said it would be good to be able to talk about the advantages of mainframe, and have a certification process for apps. SF cautioned the group on putting too much emphasis on the distinctions between Linux and Linux on System Z, can be more of disservice. MM said IBM tries to eliminate these distinctions, changing branding from Z Linux to Linux on System Z, which helps enforce this. SF sees the projects of running/validating/fixing apps to run on Linux on System Z as a good internship project. SF said the focus overall should be less on the differences, but recognize while the hardware is different, otherwise all else is the same. DH said that IBM makes available hardware at Marist and Syracuse Universities currently, with universities in Germany and China to have this soon for student access as well. SF said being able to get console access, much like how students can with VMware, is key. MF said the community focus on the dev side and ops side of the house is important. MM said he needs to think about how to do this. SF said app dev is less of an issue, but ops is. MM said the goal should be to prove capabilities, and that Linux is Linux is Linux no matter what hardware it’s running on. MM said the group should think about things more from a dev ops perspective. SF said the group should focus on getting things that should work on Linux on System Z working. SF this will eliminate objections to get discussions moving forward. MM mentioned that often people think even Java doesn’t run on Linux on System Z. MM agreed on dev ops focus. JM stated the goals as he heard them was: . Identify and eliminate objections to mainframe and Linux on System Z . Create more awareness of mainframe and Linux on System Z . Audiences are Students, Companies, and Open source project communities. MM, DH, BG, SF, and MF all agreed. MM said he’d like other members of the group to commit their hardware resources as well, and it not all be IBM. SF said he would. JM talked about the internship options. MM mentioned another option being a bounty source program, and DH asked if this is something the LF could sponsor or advertise. MM likes the idea of GSoC, DH, BG, SF, and MF all agreed. JM to follow up with more details to the group for the next meeting. JM asked about meeting cadence. MM, DH, BG, SF, and MF all agreed that every two weeks is good for now. DH also suggested we look into conference meetups if everything aligns. JM to send out recurring invite for every other Thursdays at 12:15p – 1:00pm ET invite for group starting October 15^th^.

PT asked if we could share the Charter with the group. JM said he would. PT asked if we could also have a space to share current documents, JM said he would check to see if the LF could provide a wiki and the costs, will follow up. JM presented the topics for today’s call. BH asked a question around approaching academic institutions, MM said we should focus on build a list of technologies to focus on. JM asked if we could make decision for chairperson. All agreed that we should focus on an interim chairperson for now, DH asked for it not to be IBM. Everyone agreed PT should do it. SF nominated . DH seconded . All voted for it. Phil is now Interim Chairperson . JM introduced the topic of determining projects to focus on, introduced MM to lead the discussion. MM opened the discussion, JM reminded the group of the topics discussed… . | OpenJDK . | Docker . | OpenStack . | SUSE based System Z distro . | . PT said having no presence on SUSE is hurting adoption, so it should be a priority. SF asked what made distros a priority. MM said having an image on Docker hub made getting up and going quickly much easier. SF said it sounds like devs like to avoid ops, MM said it’s less about avoiding, more about engaging the larger community much easier. BG said there is internal SUSE discussions around adding distro support, challenge is it would be slow to build it out, but it could put pressure on hardware partners as well. PT said they would love OpenSUSE in the lab environment, when it rolls into production in 6 months it will lock down. ACTION item: BG said he will report back on status at next meeting . DH said at SUSEcon they chatted about how could they move open source products at IBM into OpenSUSE. Working to setup a workshop 1^st^ or 2^nd^ week of December to layout that foundation. Could bring output of what they talk about into this session. MM said they also have traction with ClefOS image in Docker hub, will happen with Ubuntu once it hits the street. BG said this is something he believes we can make happen. May have challenge with mainframe due to lack of CPU power, MM said let’s start with SUSE and go from there. MM said goal of point 2 is to build Docker hub images of OpenSUSE. Very important for SUSE to put a base image on Docker hub. BG said there are some things to work through, but he would report back on next steps. DH said this is part of the workshop. BG and PT all agreed this should work. JM asked if we should wait till the next meeting for output of the workshops for next steps; all agreed. JM said let’s continue conversation over email. MM said he would like others to bring to the table. ",

Mr. Mertic opened the meeting at 12:21pm, welcoming the larger audience invited to help drive more technical direction and discussion within the TSC. Mr. Mertic presented the following agenda for the meeting: . - Welcome . - Review of Internship proposal . - Presentation by Anuja of IBM of the proposed code contribution. - Review of other TSC proposed projects. Mr. Tully asked the group if they were opening to changing the starting time of the meeting to 1:00pm ET for future meetings, helping him accommodate another meeting that also falls at the same time. Mr. Santalucia, Mr. Mitran, Mr. Fagen agreed with the change. Mr. Mertic took an action item to change the re-occurring meeting invite and cancel the meeting scheduled for December 24^th^, 2015. Internship Program Proposal . Mr. Mertic then discussed the internship program proposal, circulated with the group via email prior to the meeting. Mr. Gunreben said he briefly looked at the summer internship program proposal, but needs more time to review it. Mr. Tully expressed concern that students could pick projects that the TSC may not be focused on. Mr. Mertic replied that typically students will choose projects on the “Project Ideas” list, but leaving it open for new ideas often helped with engagement. Mr. Mertic explained that the proposal review process allows the Open Mainframe Project to work with the students proposing internship projects to ensure it is something that interests the students and is in the best interest of the project. Mr. Mertic then indicated that we need to have the plan completed and ready to present to the Governing Board in January. Mr. Mertic indicated that in addition to this proposal being completed, the following items need addressed. | An administrator to run the program. | Mentors identified that can work with the interns ( 1 to 1 ratio of mentors to interns ), . | A list of project ideas for the students to draw from. | . Mr. Fagen asked about the type of person that would be good for a mentorship role. Mr. Mertic indicated that this would be someone technical who could guide the intern to ensure they could complete the project. Mr. Tully asked if the mentor must be on the TSC, to which Mr. Mertic said that they can be from anywhere in the member company’s organization. Review of proposed IBM code contribution . Mr. Mertic introduced Ms. Deedwaniya to provide an overview of the announced code contribution made at LinuxCON in August to the Open Mainframe Project, for the TSC to review. Ms. Deedwaniya reviewed a deck outlining the contribution, which is the zAware Log Analytics tool. Mr. Mertic indicated that acceptance of this code contribution will require a waiver approval from the Governing Board first, as it is under a GPLv3 license while the charter requires all non-kernel contributions to be licensed under the Apache license. Ms. Deedwaniya indicated that the intention was to align the acceptance of the code contribution alongside other LinuxONE announcements at IBM Interconnect in February. Mr. Aho asked about the size of the code base; Ms. Deedwaniya was unsure and said she would check and get back to the group with an update. Mr. Aho further asked about the current state of the code; Ms. Deedwaniya said that there is some testing and validation work to be done, along with the completion of the internal IBM processes for code contributions. Mr. Everitt asked if IBM was going to retain copyright ownership of the codebase, or if that would be given to the Open Mainframe Project as well. Ms. Deedwaniya said there needs to be clarification on that. Ms. Deedwaniya asked if there were considerations for giving the copyright to the Open Mainframe Project versus IBM retaining this. Mr. Everitt said it helps guide the license used for the code. Ms. Deedwaniya said they were reviewing the copyright contribution still. Mr. Mertic indicated that next steps were for the TSC to review this contribution, and discuss it in more depth at the January 7^th^, 2016 TSC meeting. Review of TSC proposed projects . Mr. Mertic asked Mr. Mitran to walk through proposed projects listed on the wiki, as shown below. | develop a JIT for OpenJDK - multiplicative effect of enabling a lot of other projects that depend on OpenJDK . | build up the docker-hub content for Linux on z (ClefOS, OpenSUSE, Ubuntu… ) . | enhance Docker to exploit LoZ capabilities/scale . | Open Banking Project (https://openbankproject.com/) . | Open Managed Runtime project - python and/or Ruby acceleration (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOnyJurioyw) . | Blockchain performance (https://www.ethereum.org/) . | Develop a reference micro-service architecture on LoZ . | NetFlix services running on LinuxONE (http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/11/pivotal-cloud-foundry-netflix) . | Port Walmart's OneOps PaaS to Linux on z (http://siliconangle.com/blog/2015/10/15/walmart-open-sources-its-internal-paas-to-stick-it-to-amazon/ http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/14/walmartlabs-acquires-cloud-computing-startup-oneops-delicious-founders-tasty-labs/) . | . After Mr. Mitran reviewed the above list, Mr. Fagen indicated that he added another item on the list during Mr. Mitran’s presentation. | Assess and certify(?) popular Linux monitoring tools for z Systems (e.g. http://www.infoworld.com/article/2683857/network-monitoring/article.html, https://blog.serverdensity.com/80-linux-monitoring-tools-know/) | . Mr. Seay asked about integration of these project with the internship program. Mr. Mitran said this one way to do this, not per say the only way. Mr. Mitran said he would like to see within working going on in each other’s organizations, as well as engage with other communities to work together. Mr. Mertic mentioned that with focus on containerization and Docker amongst the items above, we might want to consider engaging the Open Container Project. Mr. Tully advised the group that this is the first true list the group pulled together, and should spend sometime scoping out these items in more detail. Mr. Tully further said that focusing on Docker would be good for ADP specifically. Mr. Mitran agreed with Mr. Tully that the TSC needs to whittle down and scope out the list a bit more. Mr. Mertic said that he could open the tsc@ mailing list to all technical interested parties, which could help with getting the larger group engaged. All in attendance agreed. Mr. Mitran said a dependency for Docker support is having an OpenSUSE distro image to use for Docker, as right now ClefOS is only current option and not ideal. Mr. Tully mentioned that there was discussion about an OpenSUSE distro at the last TSC meeting. Mr. Gunreben said he followed up internally at SUSE after the last meeting, and reported that there was no issue in principle in providing an OpenSUSE distro for System Z, but the challenge is that they don’t have a mainframe powerful enough to compile. Mr. Gunreben said would look to package a subset of packages for the time being, but long term need to partner with another organization for the infrastructure. Mr. Mitran asked if LinuxOne would help, Mr. Gunreben said it would. Mr. Mitran asked for next steps, Mr. Gunreben said he needed build power. Mr. Tully said he had capacity, but can’t get Mr. Gunreben access. Mr. Seay said he has some boxes, not sure if he has what Mr. Gunreben needs. Mr. Seay also indicated that Syracuse University does have boxes potentially, or perhaps IBM might have some other academic project boxes available for use. Mr. Gunreben said he would look into these options and report back to the group at the next meeting. The next meeting of the TSC was scheduled for January 7^th^, 2016 at 1:00pm Eastern Time. Mr. Mertic closed the meeting at 1:16pm Eastern Time. ",

Mr. Mertic presented the following agenda for the meeting: . - Update on OpenSUSE/LinuxOne usage for Open Mainframe Project . - Internship Review ( https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openmainframeproject/internprogram ) . - TSC Projects review ( https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openmainframeproject/tsc/projectplanning ) . Mr. Hoffman make it clear that we should try to vote on project to include today. Mr. Mertic indicated that this would be part of the ‘TSC Projects review’ agenda item. Update on OpenSUSE/LinuxOne usage for Open Mainframe Project . Mr. Tully asked for an update from Mr. Gunreben on the ability for the Open Mainframe Project to leverage OpenSUSE and Mr. Williams if we could use the LinuxOne infrastructure. Mr. Gunreben had no updates with the holiday breaks, said he would define hardware requirements before the next TSC meeting and share it over the TSC email list. Mr. Santalucia said Mr. Williams offered to provide hardware, and would work directly with Mr. Gunreben to get this going. Both Mr. Gunreben and Mr. Williams agreed to have an update before the next TSC meeting. Mr. Gunreben asked if other members could come forward with hardware and resources for the project to leverage. Internship Review . Mr. Mertic presented the program from last time, and asked if there were any questions. Mr. Mertic also indicated that we need an internship program administrator, along with commitments from member companies to provide mentors. Mr. Tully asked for someone from the academic community to step up to lead this effort. Mr. Daly stepped to lead the effort as the project administrator. Upon a motion by Mr. Tully, and second by Mr. Gunreben, the TSC voting members unanimously approved the Internship program as presented by the draft at https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openmainframeproject/internprogram?rev=1452175826, and Herbert Daly to serve as the project administrator and as such a member of the TSC as long as the project remains managed by the TSC. TSC Projects review . Mr. Mertic asked the group to re-review the project list (https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openmainframeproject/tsc/projectplanning?rev=1452175842 ) and determine which ones the TSC should charter to focus on in 2016. Mr. Tully said he would like to drive the group towards items that are fully open source, such as the OpenJDK and DockerHub content, which would require OpenSUSE environment to handle. Mr. Tully said that focusing on items without political challenges make the most sense. Mr. Wilson left the call at 1:34pm ET. Mr. Mitran said he was unbiased, and happy to see any of the projects included along with the group deciding which projects to include. Mr. Santalucia agreed with focusing on those items that have minimal political challenges, and said focusing on microservice architectures also could be good in this context. Mr. Tully thanks Mr. Santalucia for this and said he would like to get more input from others on the call. Mr. Mitran said that microservices is a natural extension to the Docker item on the list. Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Santalucia said the monitoring tools are important ones as well, as not having the same ones what is on x86 ends up being a blocker for System Z adoption. Mr. Hoffman said that he might have someone available through BountySource to handle the OpenJDK item, and said he would combine the Docker items into one and tackle. Would like to add Blockchain as well. Mr. Mertic mentioned that the Linux Foundation just launched a Collaborative Project centered around Blockchain, and also manages projects around containers, both of which could provide opportunities to engage a larger community. The group collective decided to focus on these large scale themes, and the individuals mentioned in parathesis volunteers to scope out the needs and effort more and come back to the TSC at the next meeting with a set of tasks for each area. | Develop a JIT for OpenJDK - multiplicative effect of enabling a lot of other projects that depend on OpenJDK ( Dale Hoffman ) . | Docker – ( Marcel Mitran / Dale Hoffman ) . a.

Mr. Mertic presented the following agenda for the meeting: . - Update on the Internship program . - Next steps on TSC Projects . Mr. Mertic indicated that there was not a quorum of the voting members of the TSC. Update on the Internship program . Mr. Mertic indicated that the Governing Board approved the Internship program at their regular meeting on January 13^th^, 2016. After the meeting, in discussion with the marketing committee and the academic members at large, the following recommendations were made to the proposal at ( https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openmainframeproject/internprogram?rev=1453302349 ) . | The addition of this paragraph at the end of the first section under ‘Internship Program’ | . “The Open Mainframe Project will also give the ability for each intern successfully completing the program to present their project at an industry conference. US Students will participate at the SHARE conference in Atlanta, and EU students will participate at a GSE event.

TBD Students participate at GSE Conference ————————————— —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— . Mr. Warhurst asked about the gap on the EU side between the close of the internship program, and the conference the interns would participate in, and if perhaps that gap could be made smaller. Mr. Mertic said this recommendation came from Herbert Daly who is administering the program, and he would ask him for his input prior to the vote. Mr. Mertic indicated that since there isn’t a quorum of the TSC voting members on the call, that this vote would be held via email. TSC Projects review . Mr. Mertic asked the group for updates on breaking down TSC proposals (https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openmainframeproject/tsc/projectplanning/ ) . Mr. Tully was the only one in attendance representing a project, and said he is continuing to investigate. Mr. Tully further stressed the need for the group to get more detail on the TSC Projects list, as the interns will begin applying soon and will need a good list of projects for the students to review. Mr. Seay also indicated that this level of detail is needed for recruitment of students. Mr. Tully indicated that we would send a note out to the group to get them working on detailing the list. Other Discussion Items . Mr. Tully said he would do a session at VMWORKSHOP about the Open Mainframe Project. Said it would be good to have a general deck. Mr. Mertic said he would share where is he is at with a deck via email. Mr. Tully asked what our participation at SHARE this year is looking like. Mr. Seay said he is still working with the SHARE committee to get the right contact. Mr. Seay said he would work with Mr. Mertic to setup a call with the SHARE committee contact to determine how to best engage. The next meeting of the TSC was scheduled for February 4^th^, 2016 at 1:00pm Eastern Time. Mr. Mertic closed the meeting at 1:31pm Eastern Time. ",

Introduce AMC and EMA . Mr. Mertic introduced Wolfrman Greis to introduce both EMA and AMC and their thoughts on how they could engage at a technical level. Mr. Gunreben said there is great value in this partnership, as both groups can help the OMP better engage in Germany. Mr. Edelsohn asked if these groups focused on all operating systems for Z, and Mr. Greis said yes and that they planned to offer education in the coming year. Mr. Edelson asked which machines are in the universities, and Mr. Greis said between z9 and z13. Update on the OpenJDK port to s390 . Mr. Edelsohn indicated that all the patches to enable s390 made by SAP have been completed and merged in the hotspot and snapshots for the future OpenJDK 9 release. OpenJDK 9 is scheduled for release in Summer 2017. Mr. Berthold asked if testing could start happening now, and Mr. Edelsohn indicated yes. Mr. Berthold expressed his appreciation for this. Mr. Santalucia asked that with OpenJDK s390 support, does that mean that the IBM or Oracle JDK is no longer required. Mr. Edelsohn said that this does mean that specifically, but does mean that any application that can run on OpenJDK on different architectures should now work on s390. Update on proposed focus projects . Mr. Rossi gave an update on OpenStack, indicating that after the initial proposal in September there is still questions on if OpenStack is the right platform for cloud enablement and if solving the OpenStack issues on s390 should be best resolved by the Open Mainframe Project. The recommendation with this group indicated that it would be best to pursue this as an open source project, and several end-users have come forward with interest in participation. Mr. Santalucia indicated that next steps collecting feedback and defining requirements. Mr. Rossi further asked feedback from the TSC on whether this is a worthy project for the Open Mainframe Project to focus on. Mr. Fagen had concerns of the Open Mainframe Project focusing narrowly on OpenStack on Z, and that the OpenStack community should handle this instead. Mr. Santalucia followed up saying that he felt we could supplement the work being done in the OpenStack project and not replace it. Mr. Fagen agreed that if the OMP focus was to drive more focus on Z in the OpenStack project, that would be a good thing provided we aren’t taking the place of the OpenStack code development. Mr. Rossi further said the intention is to bring more Z expertise to the OpenStack development community rather than development separately. Mr. Berthold added that there is a challenge of z/VM knowledge in OpenStack community, which the OMP could help supplement. Conversation ensued on the whether the project should focus on OpenStack. Mr. Mertic indicated work is moving ahead on scope for Blockchain on Z. A call was held earlier in the day and next steps are to see how to best engage in the community. BountySource ideas . Mr. Mertic said there was a request for help in porting some of the dependencies for Callsign to Z. Mr. Mertic said he would follow up to see the exact requirements. Meeting Cadence .

Xcat has a similar approach and does not need openstack and can handle functions on its own … | Phil: xcat- many problems, this is fully open | Something to think about : play around with LXZ package, much less the a complete cloud environment.

TSC Project updates . ADE . Shared via email by Mr. Caffery: . “I’m working on a new release of ADE 1.0.4 to integrate a number of fixes to test programs that have been provided by the community. The code has been moved to develop branch and I am doing a install test on the final package before moving it to master. It continues to get a reasonable number of people looking at the repro (10 to 30 people every two weeks).” . Cloudstack on z/VM . Ms. Hugenbruch indicated many discussions are still ongoing with at least 3 different projects to focus on. The meeting on 11/10/2017 will go over these proposals. The proposal from Mike MacIssac on developing out zoom sounds like current leading project. Still having challenges on getting the broader community engaged. Mike MacIssac will be taking over the lead on the project in the coming weeks. The primary focus of the group would be building out zoom to fill the layer between z/VM and cloudstack technologies, but would not build out OpenStack specific APIs. There would need to be a seperate project to build out the OpenStack APIs, which focusing on zoom should make easier. Internship . Mr. Mertic indicated that the internship program will be announced by Thanksgiving. Mr. Mertic asked members to bring forward project and contribute them to https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tsc/tree/master/project_proposals. Review interest in DataKinetics proposal . Mr. Mertic asked if there is any interest in the DataKinetics proposal from last week. There was no interest raised. Alignment with Linux on Z open source team ( https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z ) . Mr. Mertic raised the idea of working more directly with the Linux on Z open source team at IBM for identifying open source projects needing s390x support. Mr. Mertic overviewed a program proposal for executing on this plan. There was discussion on how to best identify the projects to focus on and the role of the TSC in identifying these projects. The following action items came from the call: . | Mr. Mertic to reach out to the Docker contact with Mr. Hoffman on copy, to make a plan for presenting how the project could sponsor building s390x content for DockerHub that could be certifed. | Mr. Mertic to setup call with Mr. Tully and the IBM Linux on Z open source team to discuss the status of that work and how the OMP could help | Mr. Tully and Mr. Santalucia to connect with various z/VM tool maintainers to see if they would be interested in the Open Mainframe Project hosting thier code. | .

    "content": "Bob Dahlberg reports that there are some new project ideas coming in, and will be working on getting some blogs going to promote. John provisioned a GitHub organization for this and said he’d work with Bob to get this populated. Matt asked if Zowe projects could be included in the Internship program, which Bob indicated that he has seen great student interest in Zowe and thinks having some internship programs in this space would be a great addition. Matt Hogstrom indicated that the Zowe project is on it’s 5th beta release, and looking to do a GA release on 1/22/2019. Matt said the main holdup has been getting the last part of the code needing to be open sourced, which will be done by then. Matt said the focus for Zowe development in 2019 is around applications built on Zowe. Matt also indicated the work is beginning on transitioning the build process to the OMP infrastructure, and the CII badge progress is progressing as well. Matt has indicated that access to Z resources has been a huge challenge, and is hoping to see that change in 2019. There was discussion on the proposed VCU infrastructure and the overall challenges of needing Z infrastructure to help drive more usage. Matt Hogstrom asked if the VCU infrastructure could leverage z/VM Cloud Connector for provisioning Mike Friesenegger offered to help get Matt Hogstrom and others interested going with using the project. Mike reported that the IBM China team is continuing to develop out the code while the internal IBM legal reviews are finishing up to bring the code into the OMP. Boris presented on the new project proposal - TerseDecompress - for inclusion in the Open Mainframe Project. There was discussion on using this as the first part of a larger z/OS tools project, as there are a number of these that have been long abandoned and could be good open source projects. In the meantime, the group indicated starting with approving TerseDecompress as a project and then expanding the project scope as more tools are identified. John said he would do a vote via the mailing list. ",

Mike F apologized for not providing the getting started guide for the project and promised to provide those instructions on usage soon. John M said TerseDecompress was approved and is in process of having the code being brought into the OMP repo. There was a discussion on additional projects to consider bringing in, with the following proposed by Rick T. | ZNETBOOT | CMSTAR | VMARC | Curl ( built using REXX ) | . John M said he would connect offline with Rick T on what it would mean to bring those projects into OMP. Rick T said he would present on the tools at the next TSC meeting. No update on ADE. Bob D said there has been 8 applicants for internship thus far, and he is expecting more as questions around applications have been coming in steadily. Bob D said the program is now open to high school students as well if they have the skills for the project they are proposing. Bob D indicated that the Project Ideas page needs cleaned up; John M indicated he could reach out to past year’s projects and move them to a historical section if they are no longer valid. Dan H and Neale shared that they have been fielding intern interest. Neale said “I have two potential interns in contact with. One for boringssl (BTLS) and the other for docker image production. For the former I am going to enable BTLS for hardware acceleration and not adding explicit big endian support. By using the h/w acceleration libraries that comes with Linux on Z we will get big endian support even if the underlying box doesn’t have the crypto facilities. Zowe has addressed all external dependencies except ZSS, which Rocket Software has been working to open source the pieces needed by Zowe. High risk for January release, but there seems to be plans to mediate those. Matt H said that little ISV engagement at this point, but getting students are starting to participate. Matt H briefly discussed the ECVTCTBL slot assignment to OMP for projects being developed. John M talked about the open PR for some updates on the process documents, would take discussion to the TSC list and a vote after a week. “Discussion on how to determine open source projects that build on s390x but have endian issues or other runtime problems” was pushed to the March meeting for further discussion.

If you need a first level z/VM, with MAINT access, it is near impossible to get. If people don't have access to the hardware/hipervisor env't, they cannont contribute. 13:30:27 From Mike Friesenegger : I agree with Mike. I was writing the following that states my opinion. John mentioned that there is no foundation or group that has to think about open source software running on x86. I believe this because access to x86 systems are easy and the lack of access to s390x hardware is a large barrier to adoption. 13:31:16 From Rick Troth : Second that. (or ... third?) 13:31:51 From Rick Troth : There are a limited number of places one can get guest access (to z/VM guests or similar). 13:31:58 From Rick Troth : The elephant in the room is ... 13:32:02 From Rick Troth : ... dare I say it? 13:33:55 From Rick Troth : Hercules 13:34:57 From Ingo Adlung : I agree. And we might want to also distinguish between „general“ software, and „system affine“ software. The first one might „just“ want to recompile, or adjust where endianness and similar issues pop up. And there is „system affine“ software which either assumes the availability of specific hardware, or build on data that can be found in one of Linux’ pseudo file-systems, and might be x86 specific and/or s390x unique 13:37:33 From Ingo Adlung : And when considering AI or more general speaking analytics software we may even face inline optimisations not available for s390x and/or explicit endianness issues. 13:49:50 From Mike MacIsaac : IBM will not allow z/VM on Hercules 13:53:04 From Ingo Adlung : scale-out versus scale-up assumptions … software might run, but might not run cost efficiently … 13:54:04 From Ingo Adlung : e.g. kubernetes workload scheduler, or Mongo sharding and data replication approach 13:56:04 From Len Santalucia : Cassandra and Scylla DB designed around the lower availability of x86 writing three copies each write. After working with them IBM Z was able to get these DBs to perform more cost effectively 13:56:35 From Mike Friesenegger : z./vm Cloud Connector? 13:58:33 From Ingo Adlung : what about the Cloud Connector, Mike? 13:59:33 From Mike MacIsaac : Ingo, we can talk offline 13:59:59 From Mike MacIsaac : My phone is 862-308-5089 if you want to talk .

Phil asked John M to bring this to the TSC voting list for approval. Mike F shared that the intern projects last year built guides for Kubernetes on various Linux distributions, and that there is a desire to take this work into a formal project that can act as a home for Kubernetes work on mainframe. Mike F indicated they would appreciate additional feedback and then would like to have the TSC vote on the proposal. ",

Ingo said he would follow up with John Arwe on the state of the Atoms plugins. The Feilong project was brought to a vote to approve renewing it’s incubation status for 12 more months. Phil T made the motion to approve, Peter F seconded, and all TAC members in attendance unianimosuly approved. Ingo said he would chat with Klaus around TerseDecompress. James Caffery said ADE is getting some viewing traffic, not too much contributions. There is a mentee interested in working this summer to add support for nginx and spark logs. James is hoping to see more parsers and anayltics as time grows. Mentorship program was launched for 2020. There was a question around what mentors should do with mentees contacting them directly; John M said they should work with mentees to understand the project and help them if they wish to submit. John M said he would give mentors view access to the list of applicants. JP Linardon reported that Zowe 1.8 is coming soon, and the onboarding squad is reviewing the Zowe Conformance Program for 2020. Rick Troth asked about licensing VMLINK. The group generally stayed away from providing licensing advice, indicating any OSI compliant license is sufficent. John M pointed Rick to the Open Mainframe Project contribution guidelines for ideas as well. Enyu announced that TravisCI now supports s390x for Linux. There was further discussion on getting them more involved in the OMP community. Peter F shared the zigi project ( https://zigi.rocks/ ), which many in the group liked. John M said he would follow up with the project leads to see if they want to present at a future meeting. ",

    "content": "Joe Devlin shared that Ambitus is moving slowly, and there is discussion on potential port that might be included that are being maintained by other organizations. There was some discussion on the differences in supporting ports on s390x versus other architecture projects. Phil Tully suggested postponing discussion on renewal of incubation status of Atom plugins and TerseDecompress until Ingo reports back. James Vincent shared an update on the CI/CD infrastructure status, with the aim of converting the existing Zowe CI/CD to be a common OMP CI/CD. Phil shared that there is a call next week to discuss this. Mike Friesenegger shared that he is working to get more contributors to the project outside of IBM to drive more requirements. Bob Dahlberg shared that we are slightly behind last year’s applicants, but there were some form issues that likely were blocking things. Bob shared that he has a flyer for schools to use, with the aim of helping drive a larger diversity of mentees to apply. Bob shared that mentees shouldn’t need to contact the mentors prior to applying, and that any mentees should be directed to apply and then the scope will be determined after the selection period. Bob said if there are questions or additional things to clarify the project, it should be added to the project description itself. Peter Fandel said Zowe 1.8 was released last week, and 1.9 is targeted towards for end of February. John Mertic shared that the ZLC is in the process of being re-elected, and that the Zowe project is updating it’s logo. John M shared updates on potential projects that he’s heard of being discussed as potential proposed projects, indicating that he would be happy to include anyone in the discussions if there is interest.

    "content": "Joe Devlin suggested that the Ambitus project has conflicts with other IBM initiatives. There was significant discussions on the concerns, and the suggestion was to escalate this to the Open Mainframe Project Governing Board representative for IBM to get clarity on two points. | Does Ambitus’s current scope conflict with internal IBM existing and emerging efforts? | Lack of Z infrastructure holding back existing and potential OMP projects? | . Ingo Adlung said he has be unable to contact the project leads for Atom plugins and TerseDecompress for updates, but will do so before the next TAC meeting. Mike F shared updates on the progress of the CI/CD infrastructure, along with efforts on getting online Z infrastructure and testing. Mike F also shared that there is a code contribution review planned for the next Feilong TSC meeting, scheduled for Thursday, March 19th, 2020 at 8:30am US Eastern Time. John M shared the following update from Jerry Edgington: . “We have been working Infinity, Inc, to get a z/OS build environment setup for the Polycephaly project. But, I don’t have any updates about VCU, at all. Next meeting, will be March 16, 2020, and the agenda has created on Github. https://github.com/openmainframeproject/polycephaly/blob/master/meetings/20200316.md” . Hiren S shared that Zorow is also having every other week TSC meetings, but attendance has been poor. Hiren S asked for help in driving interest, and there was some discussion on tactics. Len Santalucia offered to host Zorow on an upcoming webinar. John Mertic shared the updates on the Mentorship and Zowe projects. David Edelsohn shared concerns on the ‘Open Source project discovery for s390x’, and discussion ensued on that topic. John Mertic offered to connect any interested parties to that project’s planning efforts. ",

Ingo shared that Red Hat doesn’t have this functionality, though Mark said SUSE did. Holger shared that in 2015 there wasn’t anything solving these needs at the time which lead to the project being created. TAC recommended that Tessia collaborate with Feilong, and since there was no quorum the TAC chose to take the vote to the email list. Jerry indicated that progress is being made on infrastructure with Polycephaly, which has held up pursuit of graduation. TAC agreed to take to an email vote. Joe B asked for an extension of Incubation status. Work is progressing, but has taken a bit longer than expected to get to graduation. TAC agreed to take to an email vote. Ingo provided updates on TerseDecompress incubation renewal, sharing that he been working to get internal IBM developers engaged with the maintainer. There are calls scheduled next week to help enable the maintainer. John M shared Project Benefits by Stage document and GitHub best practices. Software Discovery Tool is working on porting the code from Python 2 to Python 3, and a kickoff TSC meeting is scheduled for next week. Mainframe Open Education focusing on new hires, and looking at strategies for hosting reference materials. Bob D shared 7 mentees have completed the mentorship, still waiting on 1 mentee and 1 mentee needs more time. 2 mentees dropped. ",

    "content": "Ambassador Program Update . There are 9 open applications for the Ambassador Program. The goal for year one was to cap the applicants to 10 openings and that the candidates have some tie to projects. Diversity is also one of the goals for the program. An outstanding issue is how to conduct voting. Greg: Suggested to leave the application process remain open through the end of the year. John: Next Tac meeting after the new year on the 14th. Perhaps close the day before the next Tac. Hogstrom: Asked if voting would be on the 14th. John: No reason why not. Proposes to close at 2359 on January 13th and prepare the list for voting. Public Cloud z/OS Enabelement - Kip Twitchell . Kip: The new project he is leading has seen the same issue as other OMP projects where there is a lack of access to z/OS instances. Some of the barriers are: . | Hardware - | Systems Programmers - | . Suggested to source these resources for these systems. The need is to enable access to real systems so people can learn through experimentation. This is documented in Tac Issue (blah blah blah) . Things we might need: . | How can people register for access to the system(s) | Need people that can donate system programming skills | Knowledge of what can be done that inconsistent with | . Hogstrom: Need software licenses from other ISVs . **Kip: **Other software licenses was thought of under the hardware portion of the proposal. Asked about ZD&amp;T . &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gd2md-html alert: Definition term(s) &uarr;&uarr; missing definition? (Back to top)(Next alert)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . Kip: That is an option. He thinks that might be too complicated. Other issues are the license server. Hogstrom: Mentioned the use of Dockerized ZD&amp;T running on River to support interns and other developers to give access. As a PoC showed its possible. More to do. Dalhberg: Could we identify the list of existing processes and functionality to make sure that we had a way to make it a project. Kip: Thinking out loud was considering a single (or multiple) shared systems that are multi-tenant versus other individual ones. Dahlberg: Considering some of the education they are trying to do at VCU sees the same support. Stowell: Identified there are systems today offered from vendors like IBM. Kip: That’s one option, it depends on what you’re trying. Next Steps: Begin a working group to flush this out in more detail. John: Suggesting a community to build out some infrastructure. Asking Tac to vote on formation. John volunteered to help Kip form the next level of detail. Updates on Debian . John: Haven’t seen much movement of Debian s390x support. Ingo: Still looking for feedback from Canonical. **John: **I’ll try to resurrect the thread. Terse Compress / Decompress . John: Andrew Rolly has volunteered to be the maintainer. He is based in Australia. Works with Blackhills software. Greg Suggested to defer renewal until after some time period . Hogstrom Suggested that we pair someone with Andrew and John is looking for volunteers. Hogstrom referred to an issue that occurred in Node about ensuring we know and trust commiters. https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/dk/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hacker-infects-node-js-package-to-steal-from-bitcoin-wallets . John Asked Ingo to be the “diving buddy” with Andrew. Enabling Github Actions for OMP Hosted Actions . John: There was a concern about exposing secrets. Project Updates: . Ambitus . Bostian: One TAC meeting in the last month. Accepted a request to host the ZML tool to generate Python classes from assembler control blocks. There is a new tool to scan mixed byte streams for byte order problems, and swap bytes where needed. This is coming up for the next TSC meeting. Feilong . Friesenegger: New systems were brought online for the project and they are now ready to encourage developers to contribute. GenevaERS . Randall: Over the last month they have made progress on the workbench and moved to PostgreSQL. Attracted 5 new non-IBMers to the group. Software Discovery Tool . Setting up a new call to get information from the project. Tessia . **Efremkin: **Weren’t able to complete the press release. John: More of a general statement but the OMP is pulling together the newsletter for a final push to let people know what is happening across the OMP. Zorow . Shah: Had some TAC meetings with limited attendance. Looking for how to improve participation. Mentorship . Dahlberg: Starting to prepare for summer internship. Training for mentees and mentors. Brainstorming session around January 15th to discuss different topics. Bob is looking for 10 topics and a person to lead those discussions. Bob will send out a link after the meeting to help collate these subjects. ",

Feilong incubation renewal . | Feilong is a tool that provides a RESTful API that interacts with IBM z/VM to create infrastructure (VMs, networking and disks) | Feilong is an active project with 227 merged pull requests in 2020 | Focus on 2021 goals for the project. Increasing documentation and community code contributions are two key areas. | With Vicom Infinity’s contribution of hardware resources, two second level z/VM environments available for contributors. | Started to connect with the Consolez project and will be connecting to the Tessia project where there could be some interesting synergies. | Low attendance in December/January but the first meeting in February had a better turnout. Need to focus on other avenues to promote Feilong. | Focus on graduating and report back before or by February 2022 Opportunity to seek new interest, users or contributors in future via regional group meetings or industry-wide events like SHARE? (same for other incubation projects) The vote to continue the Feilong incubation was called and approved by the voting members | . Open z/OS Enablement Working Group The Open z/OS Enablement Working group, proposed to the TAC in December has Held 5 meetings, Had perhaps 25 people participate Formulated a way of approaching the working group Established the working group repo, email lists, etc. Documented the results of the meeting in a charter readme document The charter can be located at https://github.com/openmainframeproject/wg-open-zos-enablement . Next steps for the project include: Continuing to reach out for potential code contributions Begin to focus on issues around control of loaned license and resources Recruit knowledgeable resources to define and build high value functions to reduce overhead for experimentation on z/OS (perhaps joint sponsorship with SHARE) Work with a preliminary provider to supply initial access for experimentation Discussion on Working group: Notes on discussion: Hiren - Should this be an extension of polycephally? Jerry - The build should be from polycephally - but organization should be separate Kip - There should be a cataloging about what you want with regards to license. Kip asked for coaching points: Licensing will be a big hurdle. Sean - Need to make it simple - simple because not mf experts. There is a need to define the user. Matt- what is the architecture for building the service. Lot’s of different software to be installed. Bob - don’t people already have access to development environments where they work? Kip - The need is for a place for collaboration across different companies. J.Mertic called for a vote on approval of Open z/OS Enablement (OzE) as an official working group and was passed. ",

John M indicated Open Mainframe Project was not accepted as a GSoC organization. Gregory MacKinnon reviewed the proposal revisions to the project lifecycle and TAC processes. Generally TAC members liked the changes. There were some questions on defining what being based on commercial software meant, John suggested that the principles document be a way to resolve that. TAC members agreed to discuss via mailing list and come back to the next TAC meeting to approve. John asked if any projects wish to take part in Google Season of Docs that they comment on that GH issue. Sam Golob provided a very thankful feedback to the TAC on the project impacts and growth since coming into Open Mainframe Project. GenevaERS Update: . Working towards out first release: This month we worked on different offerings for installation and testing, putting final touches on the workbench with regards to security password issues and have decided on documentation tooling. We are also making progress on poc. Zowe shared some updates on releases and progress. ",

These mailing lists are hosted at groups.io and managed by the Linux Foundation staff and Open Mainframe Project community leadership. Key mailing lists . The primary mailing list for all techincal community discussion is omp-technical@lists.openmainframeproject.org. Each hosted project and working group has it’s own mailing list as well, which are listed in the project listing in the TAC repo. Moderation and Moderation Guidelines . By default, TSC voting members serve as the moderator for discussions in omp-technical@lists.openmainframeproject.org, and each hosted project’s TSC will serve as moderator for it’s mailing lists. Moderation privledges can be extended to others upon a vote by the TAC or respective TSC as applicable. Being a moderator is as much a privledge as it is a duty. As part of volunteering to become a moderator you are now a representative of the Open Mainframe Project community, and it is your responsibility to remain aware of your contributions in this space. These responsibilities apply to all official Open Mainframe Project channels. Moderators MUST: . | Take action as specified by these Moderator Guidelines. | You are empowered to take immediate action when there is a violation. You do not need to wait for review or approval if an egregious violation has occurred. Make a judgement call based on our Code of Conduct and Values (see below). | Removing a bad actor or content from the medium is required, do NOT let it sit there. | . | Abide by the documented tasks and actions required of moderators. | Ensure that the Code of Conduct is in effect on all official Open Mainframe Project channels. | Make yourself generally available during working hours in your time zone for moderation. This can be handled as a group so that there is enough coverage of people to allow for absences/travel. | Take care of spam as soon as possible, which may mean taking action by removing a member from that resource. | Foster a safe and productive environment by being aware of potential multiple cultural differences between community members. | Understand that you might be contacted by moderators, community managers, and other users via private email or a direct message. | Keep up with software/platform changes on the property they are responsible for. This might include new UI changes, new features, or other software changes. Moderators are encouraged to meet regularly to train themselves how to be proficient with the platform. | Report violations of the Code of Conduct to pm@openmainframeproject.org. | . Moderators SHOULD: . | Exercise compassion and empathy when communicating and collaborating with other community members. | Understand the difference between a user abusing the resource or just having difficulty expressing comments and questions in English. | Be an example and role model to others in the community. In many cases, moderators are some of the first people new contributors will interact with. | Remember to check and recognize if you need take a break when you become frustrated or find yourself in a heated debate. | Help your colleagues if you recognize them in one of the stages of burnout. | Be helpful and have fun! | . Mailing list best practices . | Review your mailing list subscriptions regularly, and either change the delivery mechanism ( such as switching from indivudual emails to daily digests ) as it makes sense to keep the signal-to-noise level reasonable for you. | Keep your comments and conversation on topic | Recognize with a global community and other obligations, replies aren’t instantaneous. | Refrain from cross-posting as a way to get a larger audience to your post. | . | Be sure to contact the list moderators if there are any Code of Conduct concerns. | .

All meeting should be on the primary discussion, dev, or user calendar unless it’s a specific closed meeting to discuss a sensitive topic. | Avoid making any meeting invite changes ( including cancellations or reschedulings ) less that 24 hours in advance, as many calendaring clients do not update immediately. It’s also best practice to email that calendar’s respective mailing list to inform the group of the cancellation. | If you are rescheduling a meeting, cancel the previous one and issue a new meeting instead of doing a reschedule. Some calendaring clients don’t do well with meeting invite changes. | . Subscribing to calendars . Instructions for subscribing to an iCal calendar for popular calendaring tools: . | Google Calendar - note calendar updates only happen once daily | Outlook | Apple Calendar | IBM/HCL Notes | . Calendar management best practices . | Do ensure that any meeting invites have clearly idenified web conference or location details. | Unless the meeting is only in person, always provide a web conference for those who can’t attend in person | . | Be sure the description of the meeting has an agenda or a link to the agenda of the meeting. | Since calendaring clients can not always be good at managing changes… . | If a meeting is to be rescheduled, delete the original meeting invite and add a new one with a title denoting it being rescheduled. | Avoid cancelling meetings within 24 hours of the meeting | For changes/cancellations, email the invitees as well to inform them of the cancellation | When provisioning a new series of recurring meetings, instruct invites to remove old entries manually. | . | Courtesy Email, as a meeting lead it is a best practice to email the applicable sub-group with a note about any new meetings available, any meeting changes, or meeting cancellations. | .

    "title": "Developer Certificate of Origin",
    "content": "Open Mainframe Project requires the use of the Developer’s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO), which is the same mechanism that the Linux® Kernel and many other communities use to manage code contributions. The DCO is considered one of the simplest tools for sign offs from contributors as the representations are meant to be easy to read and indicating signoff is done as a part of the commit message. Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO: . Signed-off-by: John Doe &lt;john.doe@hisdomain.com&gt; . You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using git commit -s. Useful tools to make doing DCO signoffs easier . There are a number of great tools out there to manage DCO signoffs for developers to make it much easier to do signoffs. | DCO command line tool, which let’s you do a single signoff for an entire repo ( https://github.com/coderanger/dco ) | GitHub UI integrations for adding the signoff automatically ( https://github.com/scottrigby/dco-gh-ui ) . | Chrome - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dco-github-ui/onhgmjhnaeipfgacbglaphlmllkpoijo | Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scott-rigby/?src=search | . | . Additionally, it is possible to use shell scripting to automatically apply signing. Here is an example for bash, to be put into a .bashrc file: . git() { if [[ $1 == \"commit\" ]]; then shift echo \"Executing git commit -s $@\" command git commit -s \"$@\" else command git \"$@\" fi } . Signoff for commits where the DCO signoff was missed . When bringing in a code repository for the first time, or commits done before the DCO checks are enabled, there would be a series of commits that don’t include the sign-off statement. You can retroactively signoff commits you’ve made by make a commit with your DCO signoff that contains a new text file ( suggested name is past_commits.txt ) with the following contents: . The following commits were made pursuant to the Developer Certificate of Origin, even though a Signed-off-by: was not included in the commit message. &lt;COMMIT HASH&gt; &lt;COMMIT MSG&gt; ... Each user who has made the past commits should have thier own Signed-off-by: line in the commit message. This process can be automated using the DCO Org Check script. Handling DCO errors using GitHub website commits . The Probot: DCO app requires that the email address and name specifyed in the DCO Signoff match that of the current infortmation from the user making the commit. Generally this is handled automatically when using a local git client, but when making contributions from the GitHub website directly this needs to be aligned manually. If you are using one of the recommended GitHub UI integrations for adding the signoff automatically, you will want to ensure that the name and email listed there match that which is in your GitHub profile. Examples of the UI elements to match are below . DCO GitHub UI Configuration . GitHub user profile (https://github.com/settings/profile) . ",

    "content": "When a new project or repository is to be added, please submit a request to the Open Mainframe Project staff who can faciliate the process. Code license scan . If adding the new project or repository will include a code dump, it’s highly recommended to request a code license scan before bringing the code in. This scan will look for, and will provide recommendations (or in some case required prior remediation), for: . | Presence of third party licenses (OSI-approved or otherwise) which might be considered incompatible with the project’s license | Presence of headers with the project’s designated license(s) and preferred copyright notices in project files (refer to the License Specification in the Contribution Guidelines for more information) | Any other best practices guidance | . Typically code license scans are a fairly quick turnaround, but that might take longer for bigger code bases. Repository setup . Generally most projects coming into the Open Mainframe Project utilize the existing Open Mainframe Project GitHub organization, especially if they intend to have a single repository. This practice enables the easiest discoverablity of the project. If a project anticipates having multiple repositories, the Open Mainframe Project staff can provision a GitHub organization specific to that project. With either option, the same policies apply for adminstration and access control. Code migration . There are two strategies for migrating the code to an Open Mainframe Project managed repository. | Best practice is for the Open Mainframe Project staff to provision a new repository, where the new code can be contributed to as a pull request. | If preserving the commit history is important, then the repository can be transferred using the GitHub transfer repository process. If doing this, then before the transfer you must add a commit to the repository providing a DCO signoff for all previous commits. Easiest way is to check in a file called past-dco-signoff.txt with the contents below… | . I, &lt;AUTHOR NAME&gt; &lt;&lt;AUTHOR EMAIL&gt;&gt; hereby sign-off-by all of the commits prior to and including &lt;COMMIT_HASH&gt; to this repo subject to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), Version 1.1.

This app will block a commit without a valid DCO signoff. The DCO app should not be disabled or bypassed after it is enabled. Permissions . Projects should define a COMMITTERS.* file for indicating committers that have the ability to merge in code to a repository. The list of committers is generally approved by the TSC or the committers as a whole, aligning with the requirements described in the project’s governance. Permissions itself are managed using GitHub teams, where the TSC or committers will have a team and that team will be given ‘maintain’ permission on the repository. The best process for adding a new committer is to have that committer issue a pull request to add thier name to the COMMITTERS.* file, where the required number of TSC members or committers can +1 the request and it can be merged in by the TSC chairperson. The TSC chairperson should then tag @jmertic in the pull request and he can add the individual to the team. Branch protection .

Issue triaging can be complicated and overwhelming, especially in the context of managing a project to a release point. For projects that utilize an organization, having a single view of open issues across repositories is also very helpful in release management.

    "content": "New Zoom meetings can be provisioned by contacting the Open Mainframe Project Program Manager. Note that Zoom meetings are provisioned in a shared account across all Open Mainframe Project activities ( with the exception of Zowe, who has a dedicated Zoom account ), so you will need to coordinate use across other projects. A good way to do this is by reviewing the Open Mainframe Project calendar, which maintains a list of all community meetings. Open Mainframe Project Zoom meetings are provisioned with the following settings set to maximize security yet make community access to meetings have a fairly low barrier to entry: . | ‘Only authenticated users can join meetings’ set on | ‘Require password for participants joining by phone’ set on | ‘Identify guest participants in the meeting/webinar’ set on | Only the host can share their screen. | If the meeting is for a closed group, a password will be required to join ( which will be encoded in the URL to join the meeting that can be shared over a private channel ) | . Do not share your Zoom link on social media. This will help curtail trolls and others who would intentionally attempt to disrupt your Zoom call. To join the provisioned meeting and become host . | Have the latest version of the Zoom client installed. | Open the meeting in the Zoom desktop client | Use the host key to “claim host”. | Assign a co-host to help with moderation. It should never be your note taker unless it’s a very small group. | If you have others that need to share their screen, the host can enable that on the fly. (via the ^ menu next to Share Screen) | If you know that there will only be a fixed number of attendees at a meeting, lock the meeting to prevent anyone new from joining ( Click ‘Manage Participants’, then at the bottom of the Particpants list click More and then Lock Meeting ) | . Moderation . If you’re dealing with a troll or bad actor: . | Put the troll or bad actor on hold. The participant will be put into a “waiting room” and will not be able to participate in the call until the host removes the hold. | Remove the participant. Please be cautious when testing or using this feature, as it is permanent. They will never be able to come back into that meeting ID on that particular device. Do not joke around with this feature; it’s better to put the attendee on “hold” first and then remove. | After an action has been taken, use the lock meeting feature so that no one else can come into the meeting. If that fails, end the call immediately, and contact the Open Mainframe Project Program Manager to report the issue. | . NOTE: You can find these actions when clicking on the more or “…“ options after scrolling over the participants name/information. Hosts must be comfortable with how to use these moderation tools and the Zoom settings in general. Make sure whoever is running your meeting is equipped with the right knowledge and skills. If you have any questions or concerns, reach out to the Open Mainframe Project Program Manager and they will be able to provide further guidance and training. Related moderation documentation . | Zoom has documentation on how to use their moderation tools. | . Escalating and/Reporting a Problem .

    "content": "While video conferencing has been a real boon to productivity there are still lots of things that can go wrong during a conference video call. There are some things that are just plain out of your control, but there are some things that you can control. Here are some tips if you’re just getting into remote meetings. Keep in mind that sometimes things just break. These are not hard rules, more of a set of loose guidelines on how to tip the odds in your favor. Recommended hardware to have . | A dedicated microphone - This is the number one upgrade you can do. Sound is one of those things that can immediately change the quality of your call. If you plan on being here for the long haul, something like a Blue Yeti will work great due to the simplicity of using USB audio and having a hardware mute button. Consider a pop filter as well if necessary. | A Video Camera - A bad image can be worked around if the audio is good. Certain models have noise cancelling dual-microphones, which are a great backup for a dedicated microphone or if you are travelling. | A decent set of headphones - Personal preference, these cut down on the audio feedback when in larger meetings. | . What about an integrated headset and microphone? This totally depends on the type. We recommend testing it with a friend or asking around for recommendations for which models work best. Hardware we don’t recommend . | Earbuds. Generally speaking they are not ideal, and while they might sound fine to you when 50 people are on a call the ambient noise adds up. Some people join with earbuds and it sounds excellent, others join and it sounds terrible. Practicing with someone ahead of time can help you determine how well your earbuds work. | . Pro-tips . | If you join the meeting via the desktop or web client, make sure your name is set correctly so other attendees know who you are ( especially the person taking meeting notes! ). | Join on muted audio and video in order to prevent noise to those already in a call. | If you don’t have anything to say at that moment, MUTE. This is a common problem. You can help out a teammate by mentioning it on Zoom chat or asking them to mute on the call itself. The meeting co-host can help with muting noisly attendees before it becomes too disruptive. Don’t feel bad if this happens to you, it’s a common occurrence. | Try to find a quiet meeting place to join from; some coworking spaces and coffee shops have a ton of ambient noise that won’t be obvious to you but will be to other people in the meeting. When presenting to large groups consider delegating to another person who is in a quieter environment. | Using your computer’s built in microphone and speakers might work in a pinch, but in general won’t work as well as a dedicated headset/microphone. | Consider using visual signals to agree to points so that you don’t have to mute/unmute often during a call. This can be an especially useful technique when people are asking for lazy consensus. A simple thumbs up can go a long way! | It is common for people to step on each other when there’s an audio delay, and both parties are trying to communicate something. Don’t worry, just remember to try and pause before speaking, or consider raising your hand (if your video is on) to help the host determine who should speak first. | .
