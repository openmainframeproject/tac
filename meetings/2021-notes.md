## Notes

Thank you @mike99mac

*   Project Proposal: cobol-check [#171](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/171)
    *   Dave Nicolette 
    *   Unit test for COBOL
    *   Current COBOL test tools cannot execute individual methods
    *   Other languages have ‘test driven development’
    *   Dave started ‘COBOL check’
    *   Dave gave a demo - ran executable cobol-check
        *   Allows code to be written with built-in test cases
    *   Suggestion was added it would be better as a plugin to Eclipse or Jenkins
        *   Eclipse would probably be the first choice
    *   Question - what about VS code, and other Web IDEs?
        *   Yes - could become a VS code extension
    *   Kip T: Why bring this to the OMP?
        *   This is mainframe oriented, OMP wants to be the hub
    *   Voting members discussed if this should be added as ‘incubator status’
    *   John M: Could there be a mentor-sponsor for the TAC?
    *   Bob D: How can the OMP help this project to be successful?
    *   Phil T: We make projects more visible
    *   Bob D: Should we have a marketing plan to make it more visible?
    *   Dave N: Agrees with most comments
    *   Enyu W: Ask project owner when a good checkpoint is - 3, 6, 12 months?
        *   Dave N: 3 months would be best
        *   John M: Would everyone agree? - for the most part yes
        *   Enyu W volunteered to be a mentor for this project
    *   Len S: Are you looking for volunteers?
        *   Dave N: yes, but is there access to mainframe resources?
        *   Bob D: We may be able to get students to help
    *   John M: asked for a vote 
        *   Mark P made a motion
        *   Bob D seconded
        *   Vote was unanimous
*   Project proposal: consolez [#169](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/169)
    *   Mike MacIsaac
    *   Open source tool to expose z/VM consoles and CP commands with a Web UI
    *    video describing the first prototype here: [https://youtu.be/vD_6PXeJWdE](https://youtu.be/vD_6PXeJWdE)
    *   Mike gave a demo
    *   If anyone wants to try, email [mike99mac@gmail.com](mailto:mike99mac@gmail.com) or call at 862-308-5089
    *   Jerry E: Our shop can use this
    *   Len S: I liked it when I saw it and asked Mike to bring it to the OMP. We can use this
    *   John M: Asked for a vote
        *   Bob D: Make a motion to accept as an incubator project
        *   Mark P: Seconded
        *   Vote was unanimous
        *   Phil will mentor
*   Consider OMP Ambassador applications [#150](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/150)
    *   John presented an OMP Ambassador selections document
    *   Mark P: concern Are these people asking to be ambassadors because they were asked to?
    *   Discussion ensued about different names
    *   Consensus - people who are active in projects, then they can become ambassadors
    *   John M proposed ten ambassadors
        *   Bob D made a motion
        *   Mark P seconded
        *   Vote was unanimous
*   Project updates
    *   No time

## Action Items


## Notes

Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the note taking.

Demo using Polycephaly in different developer scenarios
Presenter: Jerry Edgington
	Helps developers focus on developing in their IDE while the compile/build is handled by Polycephaly interacting with git, jenkins and z/OS
	Great demo which can be watched on the recording of the TAC meeting

Feilong incubation renewal
- Feilong is a tool that provides a RESTful API that interacts with IBM z/VM to create infrastructure (VMs, networking and disks)
- Feilong is an active project with 227 merged pull requests in 2020
- Focus on 2021 goals for the project. Increasing documentation and community code contributions are two key areas.
- With Vicom Infinity's contribution of hardware resources, two second level z/VM environments available for contributors.
- Started to connect with the Consolez project and will be connecting to the Tessia project where there could be some interesting synergies.
- Low attendance in December/January but the first meeting in February had a better turnout.  Need to focus on other avenues to promote Feilong.
- Focus on graduating and report back before or by February 2022
Opportunity to seek new interest, users or contributors in future via regional group meetings or industry-wide events like SHARE? (same for other incubation projects)
The vote to continue the Feilong incubation was called and approved by the voting members

Open z/OS Enablement Working Group
The Open z/OS Enablement Working group, proposed to the TAC in December has
Held 5 meetings,
Had perhaps 25 people participate
Formulated a way of approaching the working group
Established the working group repo, email lists, etc.
Documented the results of the meeting in a charter readme document
The charter can be located at https://github.com/openmainframeproject/wg-open-zos-enablement

Next steps for the project include:
Continuing to reach out for potential code contributions
Begin to focus on issues around control of loaned license and resources
Recruit knowledgeable resources to define and build high value functions to reduce overhead for experimentation on z/OS (perhaps joint sponsorship with SHARE)
Work with a preliminary provider to supply initial access for experimentation
Discussion on Working group:
Notes on discussion:
Hiren - Should this be an extension of polycephally?
Jerry - The build should be from polycephally - but organization should be separate
Kip - There should be a cataloging about what you want with regards to license.

Kip asked for coaching points: Licensing will be a big hurdle.
Sean - Need to make it simple - simple because not mf experts. There is a need to define the user.
Matt- what is the architecture for building the service.
Lot's of different software to be installed.
Bob - don't people already have access to development environments where they work? 
Kip - The need is for a place for collaboration across different companies. 
J.Mertic called for a vote on approval of Open z/OS Enablement (OzE) as an official
working group and was passed.

## Agenda

Extracted from meeting-agenda labeled issues and pull requests from openmainframeproject/tac prior to the meeting.

*   Mentorship program - recruiting mentors [#185](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues/185)
*   Proposed revisions to Project Lifecycle and TAC processes [#184](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/pull/184)

*   Project updates ( list at [https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac#tac-projects](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac#tac-projects) )

## Notes

Bob Dahlberg shared that the mentorship program has expanded quite a bit since last year, with spring, summer, and fall sessions, along with a Google Summer of Code potential. There is a continual need for projects for these mentorships, please submit your mentorship projects at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jSQ6Adl7-vDoVZ-dWhc4sD4GQXxikBwImY418Ge5gJg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jSQ6Adl7-vDoVZ-dWhc4sD4GQXxikBwImY418Ge5gJg/edit?usp=sharing)

John M indicated Open Mainframe Project was not accepted as a GSoC organization.

Gregory MacKinnon reviewed the proposal revisions to the project lifecycle and TAC processes. Generally TAC members liked the changes. There were some questions on defining what being based on commercial software meant, John suggested that the principles document be a way to resolve that. TAC members agreed to discuss via mailing list and come back to the next TAC meeting to approve.

John asked if any projects wish to take part in Google Season of Docs that they comment on that GH issue.

Sam Golob provided a very thankful feedback to the TAC on the project impacts and growth since coming into Open Mainframe Project.

GenevaERS Update:

Working towards out first release: This month we worked on different offerings for installation and testing, putting final touches on the workbench with regards to security password issues and have decided on documentation tooling.  We are also making progress on poc.

Zowe shared some updates on releases and progress.

## Action Items


## Notes


*   Second monthly meeting of TAC to be on 4th thursday of the month

     z/VM community tools discussion



*   Tools exist for z/VM but are scattered
    *   Primarily, zVM development website ([www.vm.ibm.com](www.vm.ibm.com))
        *   Many tools, but some tools old enough that they may not work as originally intended
    *   Secondarily, VM Workshop ([www.vmworkshop.org](www.vmworkshop.org))
        *   All-volunteer group 
    *   Sine Nomine, Marist College, and some github content also around
*   Due to scattered nature, desire to put them somewhere unified so that they won’t get lost to time
*   If unified as a focal point in OMP, can a community form, with collab for new tools over time
    *   Improved testing due to awareness in a central place
        *   Can do validation of compatibility of tools with releases of zVM and show these results in an organized manner
    *   Focus: just tools that run on z/VM or are about z/VM
*   Concerns
    *   Being unable to contact owners? At least could provide a lexicon of the locations of tools. Ideally, offer to host the tools so that things don’t remain lost or obscure.
    *   Licensing: Ability to be flexible, but OSI-compliant is best. Some tools could have no license to begin with.
*   Project approved at “sandbox” level.

    Lfx chat



*   Open to all with an LF account, so basically open to everyone.
*   Channels are created on request at this time
*   No bots or messages migrated at this time
    *   Research to be done about if chatbots can be migrated or created
*   Idea to move some conversations over to lfx chat for getting the ball rolling… How about zowe-tsc?

    Incubation renewal - Software Discovery Tool



*   Slow start but recent progress
    *   Completed fork, migrated from python 2 to 3
*   Part of upcoming mentorship
*   Roadmap
    *   UI improvements
    *   (JSON api improvements? Didnt capture)
*   Incubation graduation plans?
    *   Determining where to go & what to be in the long run with regards to goals when considering that there are starting to be other tools that have similar missions/technologies
*   Incubation renewal approved

## Notes



*   **John M**: Javier Perez will take over the TAC voting seat in-place of Enyu Wang
    *   **Javier **gave a brief introduction of his background and his role
*   **Lauren: Mainframe Open Education Project  Incubation renewal **presentation
    *   The project has focused on the agreed to framework for the last year
    *   The team has presented at many events, have done blogs, and created videos
    *   The team wants to get new professionals acquainted with the mainframe
    *   Results of a survey will be ready by May 31st
    *   A platform for the material must be identified, github, YouTube, etc
    *   Feedback from the OMP team will help
    *   **Sean G**: Is there another step to integrate the OMP?
        *   **Lauren**: Yes, we will build that in.
    *   **Bob D**: The OMP TAC team can also add their own expertise.
    *   **John M**: Asked to vote on extending the incubation period for **Open Mainframe Education Project**
        *   The vote unanimous - Mainframe Open Education incubation phase extended for another year
*   **Sean G**:** LFX chat** has a lot of good features, but Slack is required by some organizations, and has a better track record.
    *   **Mike F**: will discuss chat options with the Feilong team.
    *   **Alex**: Who will manage the chat servers?
        *   **John**: The Linux Foundation
*   **John M**: **Debian support for s390x**
    *   Debian team is concerned there aren’t enough maintainers, so s390x could be dropped
    *   **Ulrich W**: clarified - it’s not so much packages, as there is a need for an overall maintainer - previous developers in this role have moved on - ideally a non-IBMer would be in this  role or maybe two people
    *   **David E**: A lot of knowledge of the build process, and low-level details of the boot process of s390x are needed. 
    *   **Mark P**:  Canonical should be involved as Ubuntu is based on Debian
        *   **John M**: There were some discussions with Canonical - not sure of the results
        *   **Mike M**: will reach out to a former s390x colleague who is now at Canonical
    *   **John**: What is the timeline for this maintainer?
        *   Ulrich: The time may have already passed
    *   **Johh/Bob**: discussion on whether this is a good role for a mentee. Is there someone who would be a mentor in the Fall cohort?
        *   **Ulrich**: I may not be the best person, but I could help.
        *   **Bob D**: A definition of the project is needed.
        *   **Len S**: Mike M, can you get a name from Canonical who will be a contact?
            *   **Mike**: I’ll try
        *   **Dave E**: The previous maintainer did not have a main point of contact. Could the OMP take on this role?
        *   **John M** and **Bob D** discussed how this could be moved forward
        *   **David E**: I propose that the OMP take on the role of being the point of contact.
            *   **Bob D**: Agree this should be an action item 
            *   **Ulrich Weigand**: I will help
        *   A starting group will be John, Bob, David and Ulrich

## Action Items


## Notes

Hiren Shah gave an annual review update on Zorow. 

Questions from the group:



* What is holding Zorow back from graduating?
    * Technical perspective - nothing major
    * Lack of commits and contributors has been the primary blocker.
* Questions on if there are some distribution channels that could help uptake
    * Not sure, but good to think about
    * Feedback is to look into this more, as distribution channels make an impact on project ecosystems
    * Also would different formats of consuming help?
    * Suggestions of git in USS and Jenkins to pull it. Also explore other channels.

TAC asked the project to set goals to move towards Active stage. Joe Bostian and Kip offered to mentor and work with Hiren.

Motion to renewal incubation, Kip move, Bob second, all approved.

Presentation for Atom plugins to be rescheduled.

No progress on LFX Chat

Project updates:



* **Open z/OS Enablement WG**- focusing on ecosystem development learning, waiting to see if a community available Z instance comes available.
* **Debian s390x WG** - Elizabeth looking to pick this up, working to get practices from SUSE community.
* **Software Discovery Tool**- mentorship program winding down, VM launched this morning to host this. Working on new Debian release.
* **Mainframe Open Education** - aligning on a learning management system (LSM) for this, John to connect them with LF Training.  Open Education Project is looking into a Moodle currently as a potential LSM
* **ConsoleZ** - quiet over the summer, meetings starting up in September. Several presentations recently, one at Open Mainframe Summit next month. Working on some issues with the throughput of large files and getting into historical logs.
* **Zowe** - getting engagement on upcoming events. Zowe is readying a survey to the user community. ZLC has fully transitioned to the Zowe Advisory Council (ZAC), now that the TSC has taken leadership of the project.
* **Mentorship** - winding down on summer mentorships. Fall mentorships with Western University and VCU in college credit mentorships. Starting to look for projects for spring - several universities interested in college credit mentorships. Also looking for summer mentorship projects. Looking for help in managing the mentorship program as well.
* **GenevaERS** - lots of energy from the active status. Continuing work on Spark integration. Expanding demo system to include workbench and download capabilities. Website getting transferred over to the LF.
* **COBOL Programming Course** - summer mentorship program winding down, courses updated with Zowe additions. Mentees will stick with the project going forward and be featured in several upcoming events.

**Tessia**

Mr. Tuly motioned to renew project for another year at the incubation stage, Mr. Dahlberg seconded the motion, all approved.

**CBT Project**

Sam Golob gives update and appreciation for LX Foundation OMP Support.  CBT still supports the last free version of MVS.  Contributions from 2 sources, (1) people working for large companies with large computers, and (2) retired mainframers that are using OMP resources to add to the CBT.  

Mr. Tuly motioned to renew project for another year. Mr. Twitchell seconded the motion, all approved.  Issue brought up that maybe TAC should consider grandfathering the CBT project into active status considering it is the oldest project (founded in 1987).

## Notes

**Mentorship Review** \
Mr. Dahlberg provided an update on the Mentorship program. Mr. Twitchell asked what the impact/success of the mentorship program is having on the mentees after completion. He also reviewed the process for the selection of the mentees. Mr. Dahlberg is looking to start Mentorship committee meetings after finals.

**Ambassador Program** \
Mr. Winchester shared his positive experience with the program. Mr. Twitchell expressed interest in joining in the future and asked what the impact has been thus far. Mr. Dahlberg suggested having participants create videos that live on YouTube explaining what they are ambassadors for. 

No update for TerseDecompress. Mr. Mertic will assist with reviving that conversation.

**2022 Goals and Objectives** \
Mr. Mertic reviewed the plan for 2022. The presentation is available in GitHub for everyone to review and bring any questions to the next meeting in January
