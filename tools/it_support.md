The Linux Foundation provides support for the infrastructure hosted by the {{ site.foundation_name }}. This document outlines the included services available to projects.

## IT Support

Linux Foundation provides direct support for the following infrastructure:

- [Mailing Lists]({{ site.mailing_list_url }})
- [{{ site.foundation_name }} Confluence wiki]({{ site.wiki_url }})
- [{{ site.foundation_name }} website]({{ site.website_url }})
- [LFX Insights]({{ site.lfx_insights_url }})
- [LFX EasyCLA]
- [LFX Project Control Center]

If you need support with using any of these tools, please file a support ticket at [support.linuxfoundation.org].

Tools not listed above are maintained by the individual project communities and not supported by the Linux Foundation directly.

## Domain management

{{ site.foundation_name }} both manages the domain renewals and DNS for all project domains. Projects can request both new domain purchases, transfer of existing domains to the {{ site.foundation_name }}, as well as request redirect or service-specific subdomains, by creating an [IT Request][Domain IT Request]. For domains that are not available, {{ site.foundation_name }} may be able to purchase the domain from it's existing owner pending budget approval.

## Build Infrastructure support

{{ site.foundation_name }} does not provide support for any project build infrastructure.
