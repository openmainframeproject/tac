# Project Benefits by Stage

Open Mainframe Project hosted projects can leverage the world-class Linux Foundation staff to help drive further awareness and support of their projects. Project needs tend to be different based upon the project's maturity, and the Open Mainframe Project aims to ensure that the benefits are tailored to those needs appropriate for its maturity.

Open Mainframe Project is always open to feedback on the benefits provided feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac/issues) to share any feedback.
