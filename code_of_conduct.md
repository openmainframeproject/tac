# Code of Conduct

{{ site.foundation_name }} aims to foster a collaborative, inclusive, and safe environment for all participants. {{ site.foundation_name }} and each hosted project has established a Code of Conduct to help provide guidelines on appropriate conduct and how to report violations.

For all hosted projects, refer to the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file in each code repository that points to the policy in use.

For all other activities and events that are sanctioned by {{ site.foundation_name }}, refer to the [LF Events Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

## How to Report a Violation

Please send an email to [conduct@openmainframeproject.org](mailto:conduct@openmainframeproject.org).

## Violation Review Process

Upon receiving a violation claim, staff members will review violations confidentially.  The claim(s) will be investigated within three business days.  After the investigation, a private session with the Technical Advisory Council will be held to review the violation and to determine the appropriate course of action.

## Enforcement

### 1. Warning

#### Community Impact

A violation through a single incident, including the use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

#### Consequence

A private, written warning from the TAC, providing clarity around the nature of the violation, an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate, and a warning with consequences for continued behavior.

### 2. Temporary Ban

#### Community Impact

A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

#### Consequence

A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time, not to exceed 30 days. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with the TAC, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 3. Ban

#### Community Impact

Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

#### Consequence

A ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. Bans persist until a TAC majority approves a ban repeal. Banned parties must submit their ban appeals, waiting at least 365 days from the ban date or the previous appeal submission if rejected.
