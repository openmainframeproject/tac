## Notes

### Google Season of Docs/Summer of Code #444
    
Projects generally haven't looked at GSoC/GSoD, and don't have bandwidth to do.

### Review Sandbox projects #415

From the previous meeting, TSTerm has issues with ease of adoption ( hard to get people to use the code ). TMZ is easier to get hands-on, but technically inferior. Need to be fixed; a potential idea was to build an electron app to ease usage.

Current TSTerm is stalled on development, but will pick up once brought into Zowe as a dependency. Zowe is planning to integrate this during the next PI as the default terminal emulator for Zowe Desktop. Decided to do next review in June 2023.

Review scheduled in #453
    
z/VM Community Tools no longer has a leader, and TAC considering moving to Emeritus. Will ask Phil Tully about the status, and if not will consider moving to Emeritus. Lionel Dyck indicates tools are still in development, so the need is there. John M indicated just need a leader. Will ask Len S about getting enangement with VM Workshop. Ingo will also follow up.

Review scheduled in #454
    
### Add in Ambassador requirement to participate in one activity per quarter. #413
    
Recommendation was to change to once per half year, otherwise everyone was good with the requirements. 

TAC approved - motion @Sudharsana-Srinivasan second Greg MacKinnon. Unanimously approved.
    
### Call for Ambassadors and renewal of existing ambassadors #405

Agreed to close new nominations, John M to provide list of applicant in a Google Sheet for the TAC to review and rank.
    
### Discuss Mainframe Project Onboarding Process #399

John M to pull group together to work on seperately.    

### Project updates
    
- COBOL Programming Course - had first monthly call, working on focuses for 2023 and planning Q1 TSC call. Will be bringing in COBOL Check to potentially integrate into the course 
- GenevaERS - began testing MR91 on mainframe, replaces partial C++ component. Tech writer has had a job change so that work is paused; doing knowledge transfer to others.
- Zowe - [PI planning this week](https://github.com/zowe/community/tree/master/Project%20Management/PI%20Planning/23PI1%20Planning). Documentation focus for z/OS native code from relevant squads. Zowe 2.6 to release next week; server code will be able to load configuration from different sources, adding documentation for getting Zowe extensions from package managers such as npm.
- CBT Tape - working on mirroring to GitHub. 
- Software Discovery Tool - Added updates for latest SUSE, Fedora release. Interest from IBM POWER team using the tool.
- Zorow - No updates; do know of usage of z/OSMF workflows being used, but they are specialized and not likely to be contributed. Continue to advocate.
- Linux Distributions WG - Talk at FOSDEM around collaboration across distros.
- Modernization WG - monthly meetings, focused on getting organized, how to produce documentation, and work together.
