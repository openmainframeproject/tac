#### Notes
Mr. Mertic opened the meeting and followed up on the scaling up presentation- Mr. Santalucia asked Mr. Metric if he could pick three main points out of the presentation, what would they be. Mr. Mertic responded with: 

	#1- Analyzing how new contributors would look at the project and how they would get involved/participate. 
	#2- Watching out for project burnout and stepping in to help others prevent this,
	#3- How you can get into an area of individual enablement to mass enablement.
