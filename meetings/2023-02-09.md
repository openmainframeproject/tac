## **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Notes</span>**


**CD Foundation Best Practices SIG:**  
The initial meeting was held on Jan 25, 2023, with CD Foundation attendees + people from Google, Netflix, Splunk, MongoDB. The CDF goal is to: “normalize” terminology, focus on the abstraction of tech/tools, and identify and document best practices.

The Open Mainframe Project strategy (Zowe) was well received. The next steps include developing a Whitepaper, and providing access to the mainframe sandbox environment.

Call-to-action - In need of balanced participation from the mainframe ecosystem in the SIG discussions.

**Ambassadors**:  
Some TAC voting members still need to vote. It was decided to wait until the next TAC meeting in order to obtain more votes. Reminders will be sent to those who have not voted.

**ADE and COBOL Check Annual Reviews:**
These will have to be rescheduled. Ms. Kilborn will work will the leads. 


**Mainframe Project Onboarding Process:**

A group has been meeting to establish the process and resources/configurations for the mainframe. The TAC asked about the use, whether commercial or educational. Mr. Mertic mentioned it would not be commercial and it would likely be primarily like a CI/CD environment. Start with the most common use case. Mr. Dahlberg has some questions and will connect with Ms. Srinivasan for some clarification. An LPAR around education may be needed. 
 
Each project would have to provide a report at the end of the year.

This group meets weekly and members are welcome to join. 
 


**Project Updates:**

**COBOL Programming Course:** Ms. Srinivasan said they are meeting with COBOL Check to see if they can move ahead with debugging and testing. Mr. Bauer mentioned they continue to get more people registering and consuming the course.

**Zowe:**
Mr. Grady announced a new Event Management working group exploring the boosting of event management for Zowe. It is in its early stages to see what technology is needed to be successful. They meet Tuesdays at 10 am EST if anyone is interested and has ideas to contribute. 
 
**Open Mainframe Education**: Ms. Joseph mentioned they are still considering the mentorship program for the summer term, but they are a little tight with their resources.

 
**Tessia**: Mr. Efremkin mentioned being interested in being a use case as an infrastructure tool on the Mainframe.

**Cobol Working Group:** Sarah attended Fosdem (a video is available online) and mentioned there is a group that may be interested in joining.
