**Reminders on Open Mainframe Summit-** Coming up in a month. If a project would like to host a meeting, there is space available. Reach out to us to secure space.

**COBOL Working Group Annual Group-** Mr. Seay provided an annual review for the COBOL Working Group. He noted that statistics are indicating COBOL is experiencing an increase and not a decline.  They are up to 104 members and participation has increased. Ms. Joseph asked for slide decks to help others when asked about COBOL.There is not a quorum so the vote to renew will be taken via email. \
 \
**Review Maintainer and Member Survey results-** Surveys were sent to members and project maintainers. Results show the majority of respondents see value in Brand amplification. They feel connected with benefits and staff regarding needs and see the TAC as supporting. Mr. Santalucia asked what we will do with surveys. We will as a staff look at results and look how to improve and in this case, how we can increase marketing visibility.

**Project Updates-** 

**Ms. Joseph-** Will be talking at the Open Mainframe Summit. Software Discovery Group has been working on the mentorship, mainly on moving the text space backend to a database. They have added a new Z/OS Open Source on Github. 

**Zowe-** Mr. Grady is at Share. There is a large representation at Share. He is getting word out about V2. Working on code freeze for 2.3 next week.
