## Action Items


## Notes

Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the note taking.

Demo using Polycephaly in different developer scenarios
Presenter: Jerry Edgington
	Helps developers focus on developing in their IDE while the compile/build is handled by Polycephaly interacting with git, jenkins and z/OS
	Great demo which can be watched on the recording of the TAC meeting

Feilong incubation renewal
- Feilong is a tool that provides a RESTful API that interacts with IBM z/VM to create infrastructure (VMs, networking and disks)
- Feilong is an active project with 227 merged pull requests in 2020
- Focus on 2021 goals for the project. Increasing documentation and community code contributions are two key areas.
- With Vicom Infinity's contribution of hardware resources, two second level z/VM environments available for contributors.
- Started to connect with the Consolez project and will be connecting to the Tessia project where there could be some interesting synergies.
- Low attendance in December/January but the first meeting in February had a better turnout.  Need to focus on other avenues to promote Feilong.
- Focus on graduating and report back before or by February 2022
Opportunity to seek new interest, users or contributors in future via regional group meetings or industry-wide events like SHARE? (same for other incubation projects)
The vote to continue the Feilong incubation was called and approved by the voting members

Open z/OS Enablement Working Group
The Open z/OS Enablement Working group, proposed to the TAC in December has
Held 5 meetings,
Had perhaps 25 people participate
Formulated a way of approaching the working group
Established the working group repo, email lists, etc.
Documented the results of the meeting in a charter readme document
The charter can be located at https://github.com/openmainframeproject/wg-open-zos-enablement

Next steps for the project include:
Continuing to reach out for potential code contributions
Begin to focus on issues around control of loaned license and resources
Recruit knowledgeable resources to define and build high value functions to reduce overhead for experimentation on z/OS (perhaps joint sponsorship with SHARE)
Work with a preliminary provider to supply initial access for experimentation
Discussion on Working group:
Notes on discussion:
Hiren - Should this be an extension of polycephally?
Jerry - The build should be from polycephally - but organization should be separate
Kip - There should be a cataloging about what you want with regards to license.

Kip asked for coaching points: Licensing will be a big hurdle.
Sean - Need to make it simple - simple because not mf experts. There is a need to define the user.
Matt- what is the architecture for building the service.
Lot's of different software to be installed.
Bob - don't people already have access to development environments where they work? 
Kip - The need is for a place for collaboration across different companies. 
J.Mertic called for a vote on approval of Open z/OS Enablement (OzE) as an official
working group and was passed.
