**Action Items**
 
**Notes**

**Software Discovery Tool annual review-**
 Ms. Joseph provided a review of the Software Discovery Tool Project, they are not yet ready to graduate.  Mr. Twitchell asked where the committer diversity comes from. Ms. Joseph believes it is partly from Whose problem does the tool solve and why should they contribute? What would the tool do for them that helps with “personas.” Mr. Metric asked if they have had interest from outside mainframe communities; Ms. Joseph said no but it may be something to look into.
A motion to approve the Software Discovery Tool project for another year of incubation was made by  Mr. Twitchell and seconded by Mr. Dahlberg, all were in favor.

**TerseDecompress incubation renewal-**
There was discussion about moving this project into an Emeritus status after six months of inactivity. Per the charter, this can be done with two-thirds TAC board vote.
Mr. Twitchell motioned to move this into an Emertius status, Mr. Bostian seconded the motion and all were in favor.

**Reminders on Open Mainframe Summit-** Mr. Mertic let the TAC members know that the board met on 5/11 and they are exploring converting to a hybrid option and adding a virtual option. Mr. Santalucia said he spoke to some people and they were happy to hear this.

**Project Updates-**

GenevaERS- will be transiting the TAC seat.
