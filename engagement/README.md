# Getting Involved in Projects

All of the projects hosted at the Open Mainframe Project are open and transparent, and welcome participation from anyone interested in the technology areas. Each project publishes thier governance processes within thier project repo ( typically in the README.md file or in a GOVERNANCE.md file within the primary project repo or TSC repo ) on roles within the community and how decision making is made.

Below are resources to helping you get more involved in projects.
